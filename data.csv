Like my grandparents used to do that, but it was because they were poor. You know? The grape truck made wine. Yeah, the grape truck would come around the neighborhood in Brooklyn and pe. Everybody would buy grapes, and then down in the basement they'd make the most disgusting wine possible. That's true. That's absolutely true. That's wild. And then they's pour soda in it because, and it's like an Italian thing. When the wine's not very good, you pour soda in it and it doesn't taste as bad. Yeah. What kind of soda do they put it in? The wine. Like Sprite or something like that? Yeah. Yeah. That's strong. Is it National Viagra Day? Did you It's, well, it's the anniversary of Viagra. Oh, thank God. Yeah. 25th anniversary. Yeah.

I'm not gonna tell you man's that's gonna happen in the future. I don't wanna give away my secrets. Look, I play, I play make believe for a living. Yeah. So I can always find something. Fun to talk about something that I enjoy doing. And you just, you know, so it's acting then in a way, when you come out, it's a pure con Yeah, it is. It's a way of tricking people out of like $13. Yeah. Yeah. But this one, you don't have to trick. And that's nice. It's really good for relaxing, right? You were in, uh, yeah, it does. We were in Westwood, well, we've been all over the world. We were in Berlin and, uh, Paris and London, a, a full, uh, tour. And then last night at Westwood, like my favorite theater in la. It's this gorgeous old, uh, I don't know if it's a deco theater, but you know, one of those beautiful old LA theaters. Which one was it? Um, the Westwood. Um, oh yeah, I know which one that is. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Where all the big, big premieres are? It's, it's across from Didi Res, right? Yeah, yeah. All the big premieres are there. Yeah, it's like 1200 seats. And it was like a rock concert. Did you bring a lot of people to it? I brought 60 people. Oh, that is a lot of people, like your whole family and everything. Family, friends of family, people I didn't know from off the street. Just like anything to kind of build up the, the, the audience. So someone who lives here is wondering if they are your friend or not and they did not get invited to that premier last night. The answer is no. Yeah. Thanks, pal. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Uh, but yeah, it was a fun night. Uh, people loved the movie. People liked the movie. Yeah. I mean, you know. And then afterwards you go into the party and everybody's shaking your hand and you're feeling, you're feeling good. You gotta hit film and, uh, I'm feeling great shaking hands, but I appreciate, don't worry. Thank you so much. Yeah, you're, we had a blast doing it and then these two beautiful women come up to me and they shake my hand and they say The movie was so great, you know? Thank you so much. Is your father here? Really? My father's on a TV show called Chip. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah. Uh, so then I end up having to basically chap around my father and take selfies with. This gaggle of people that have surrounded my father. Does he like that? He stole my thunder. He did? Yeah. Yeah. But I was very happy. Well wait till Tuesday. You know you'll be back. You, uh, you were very hairy the last time. Uh, you were on the show. You had a, you know, beard. You had a big beard. You really were going, what's the beard sound? That's weird. Weird. Yeah. Like you, what happened? Did you get bugs in that thing or what was the, why'd you, oh shit. It was the dead of summer in Burbank. It was 110 degrees. And I was like, I'm not liking this. Uh, yeah. And then I said, screw it up. I went home and I. Shaved the whole thing, which felt great for like five minutes. Then I realized how much gray hair I am. Oh yeah. Right. This is a, a photo of your long hair. This is Beardless. But, um, now I heard you say something, I heard you say something about this and what, what, what it made me feel like, I dunno if this, what made me feel like, but, so as you, okay. Let's just break down this photo. Yeah. This guy, uh, Feeling it Uhhuh. Really? He's feeling it. He's feeling very cool. Uhhuh. This is right before my publicist says that I looked like Rachel from friends. Why is that not a compliment? Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, yeah. You should have said thank you is what you should have said. No, I shouldn't have, man. Why? Because I mean, Listen. Have you ever seen a better looking human being than this? Right here? Come on now. Not a chance. No, I'm not taking away from Jennifer. Don't throw me under the bus like that. I think Jennifer Anderson's a beautiful woman. Yeah, right. You just, I'm a man. You did the hair. Yeah. Well, we'll figure out. But anyway, so, you know, we'll do, we'll take a commercial break and I'll check you in and we'll see. Um, if, yeah, I'll check your parts. You know what I'm saying? Don't check my parts. Listen, you brought me flowers on why we gotta do something. Yeah. Chris Pine is here. His movie is Dungeon and Dragons Honor Monkey. See exactly that you bring to this. Me. I'm a I'm a planner. Yeah. Make plans. You've already made plants. So what value do have now if, uh, the plan fails? The existing plan? I make a new plan. So you make plants that fail? No. D also plays the loot. Hogan, not relevant, trust me. I'm mean, indispensable. That is Chris Pie. It opens in theaters only. It's only gonna be in the movie theaters. So only the great movie theaters. It's, it's a fun one to see with the cro. Got like a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is especially, but even more importantly for audience scores. I mean, the audience is, I gotta tell you. And this is not bs. This is not me trying to sell, but seeing it with a group of people reminds you how awesome a cinema experience can be and like why? Why you do it, why you make it, why you go to it. To share in that experience. It's really, really, you just finished directing and you wrote and directed and starred in a, a movie. Yep. Co. Who is, who else is in that movie with you? Annette Benning. Danny DeVito. Oh, wow. Uh, Jennifer, Jason Lee. Wow. Uh, Dewan De Wise. Stephen Tobolowsky, one of my favorite characters. He's great of all time. Yeah, me too. I love that guy. Um, Clancy, uh, brown, we have, uh, now we're getting too deep into the list. Okay. Yeah. Um, um, But it's a great, I stop you at Tobolowsky. To, Tobolowsky is great. Uh, DeVito seems like a guy who makes everything fun. Like he's, you've had him on yo many times and he's always so much fun. Like even in the commercials, he's fun. That I gotta tell. I mean, what I learned from DeVito, it's like a life lesson, which is like you face everything with absolute joy. Everything's joyful. You wanna do, press is joyful. Sitting in the trailer's joyful, lunchtime's, joyful. Let's go to craft surfaces. Joy, it's always positive. It's always, he's trying to make, he loves bits, he loves, you know, getting into the, getting into it. When does that movie come out? I don't know. You don't know? Okay. I don't know. I made it, I'm waiting to sell it now. I'm in the, this kind of per I got you. Okay. Experience of the making it, I can figure out this whole other business thing. But he's a, he's a trip. I rode him. I wrote him, uh, first of all, keeping, being a straight face with Danny DeVito is nearly impossible. Uh, him, his lines nearly impossible. Um, but, uh, but if you give him something to write himself, he can Did he write something himself? So I have this thing where I wrote him a monologue and he is like, nah, I don't wanna do that. It's like, okay. And then wrote another model like, nah, but I don't wanna do that. It's like, well, Danny, why don't you, what do you want to tell me? He sent me seven pages of stories that he wanted to talk about. True stories. True stories. Wow. That he knew off, off book. Uh, I mean, unless he was reciting from the pages when he talked to me. But, uh, but anyways, so we, we go to, uh, we go to set and he has like a couple that, uh, that he's, he might do. And I was like, what about that one? He's like, no, I can't do it. I don't, I don't wanna do that one. So then he launched into this page and a half monologue that he knew. Off book. Perfect. It's delicious and wonderful and perfectly DeVito and it fit the film. But anyway, when you see it, that's all DeVito. That's pretty great. Yeah. Now this, I'm curious about Dungeons and Dragons as far as, have you played Dungeons and Dragons? I played it twice. Played it twice? Yeah. Okay. So you're not gonna pretend to be a Dungeons and Dragons. Master, I can pretend to be a dungeon. Oh, you me, because we have, yeah. Someone on our staff who we recently learned as we're talking about this movie is a, a dungeon master, as they call it. This is a person, I've bet a lot of people are, anybody, is, does anybody play here? No. Okay. You know what? It's one of the questions. It's one of the questions we ask at the door. So let's bring our coworkers out here. We have three coworkers, and Chris, you're gonna have to find out who's the dungeon master. Okay. And we'll see if you can, yeah. Alrighty.

Instead of dealing with a monster, they spend all of their time flirting with acute half elf npc. How do you get them back on track? Oh, wow. That's a great question. Uh, dragon takes the cute NPC away. Ooh, okay. Did, does that make sense? Yeah. Run in and run in and grit snatch it. Megan, do you agree with that? Um, that's better. I was gonna say, punish them for wasting time and maybe turn the MPC into like a succubus or something and make them fight it. Lou, uh, I was gonna say that the, the elf girl was a dragon all along the elf girl. Okay. Yeah. Alright. You, yeah. Megan's the Dutch mess. Oh, you're saying? Oh, you're guessing already.

His new movie directed by Ben Affleck is called Air. It Opens the Theaters one week from today. Please welcome Jason Bateman. Wow. What a role you are on Jason Bateman. I mean, fresh off, winning all the awards during award season. You come out with this of them movie 'em All Air, you pop in there. People are talking about Ben Affleck and that other guy, and then there's you stealing the show right in the middle of this movie. Oh man. What must it be like? To be you besides that, um, haircut from the eighties that you still have. That's a big laugh. It's an offensively big laugh. Yeah. This whole pigeon wing over here. Yeah. I've gotta get rid of. Right. Because the movie's over. I think I kept it for possible reshoots. You did, but now it's released and so I can cut it. I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Unless you're shooting the sequel now and we don't know about it. My wife Amanda, won't. Sleep with me with short hair, so I've gotta Is that true? Mm-hmm. She prefers long hair. She does? Yeah. How long does she want it? Uh, well anything that makes me look a little bit less like the Jason Bateman, she knows she's looking for Teen Wolf too. Jason Batman. She's looking a spice too. Exactly. So she wants me to grow my nails out. Oh, by way I still miss the magic elevator. Can we bring that back? Yes. The, uh, yes, the, the elevator you're obsessed with. It was a pretend elevator. Wasn't really the elevator or carpeted or something. What brainstorm. Let's talk about your projects case, because you are the star right now. We are focused on you. You are This movie, movie, by the way. I told Ben Affleck. It's, you know, you know, especially love it. It is a love letter to the eighties. It is. So eighties from the music and the, just everything about it is you love the a I should love the eighties cuz I, I was, I was doing very well in the eighties. Mm-hmm. And so, like all of this, Jimmy, I'm sure you were about to say, I'm sorry to cut you off. No, no. I wasn't about saying it loves eighties music. I do. I love it. Yeah. Like in an unhealthy way. He just thinks it's the greatest music decade. Of course it is. I mean, like, Cleo, this right, this is totally wrong. It's just like couldn't. Oh yeah. He loves it. Yeah. No, he, the eighties was not, was not the Guido and I I, you couldn't possibly match anyone who has my musical taste more similarly than you love the A. Okay. So what were you two doing that was so great in the eighties? Where all that music just brings back the glory days. What were you guys crushing in the eighties? I don't know. We weren't doing coke like you, we were, we were drinking. We were drinking new Coke is what we were doing. There's Soma, come on. Bruce Springsteen, Madonna, Lionel Richie, prince. You too. Van Halen, Metallica. I mean the birth of hip hop. Every hip hop. The music started there. It was fun, but it wasn't like there's reverence with you with this decade. That's right. What is yacht Rock on your Oh, absolutely. All the time. Right all the time. Yeah, absolutely. Molly's gonna jump out the window one day on the 4 0 5. This is such a betrayal to the decade that built, that made Jason Batton. This is like if Pacman came out and said the heck through the eighties. I'm not eating those pellets anymore. Wait a second. Am I the Screen Actors Guild, Pacman? No, no, no. I think that's what you, you're more, you like Cubert. You're more of a cuber. That was a nasties thing you've ever said to me, by the way. I was. Fantastic. At Cubert. Yeah. Were you really? No, I was. No, I wasn't, I wasn't better than, than the games that we had on Silver Spoons. I mean, Ricky and I had Pacman Dragons Layer, centipede and uh, uh, uh, missile or, uh, anyway, one of them, we just, we, we rocked it. We, because you know, you could play it for free all the time. It came too easy to you. That's what your problem with the eighties is. We had to Pacman quarters, tournament quarters and quarters. You were in a Pacman tournament tournament. And placed very well. You did? Yeah. Against like regular players? Nah, there was other celebrities. Celebrities in it too. Yeah. Just like me. Uh uh. Think people sponsored it. I had a little Pacman trophy. Oh my. Oh God. The eighties were horrible. No. This movie is proof that they were, and in fact, I believe we have the first time type thing that came outta the, you dabbled in Michael Jordan. Um, paraphernalia was, um, right here. The, there you go. I mean, how is that not in the show, in the movie, by the way? More muscles in that picture than I currently have. What was which, which of the many gems from the eighties is that from, I put the way my forearms are bigger than my biceps. You know, it's just a perspective. Don't get down on yourself. I'm like a veal. It's terrible. Um, so that, that is the opening, uh, credits to Valerie or the Hogan family or whatever we were calling. Oh wow. Yeah. You see, that's one of the things I love. Yeah. And so, yeah. So that's the bulls. That's uh, that's my bull. Did you shave your armpits then to look more like a boy? I was on swim team. You work? Yeah. There's no hair anywhere. Um, and that, that was a piece that was, did they give you Jordan's to for effort as part of the movie? Was that part of the deal? No. And you would think, cuz I realized from doing this film that I've never had a pair of Jordans. I've worned Nikes my whole life, but I never for some reason never bought a pair of Jordans. Um, and, and I thought that maybe, you know, oftentimes when you're done with the project, the, the director will usually give a gift to the cast and the crew and it'll be somehow themed tied into the film itself. I thought for sure. Cuz we can make our own Nikes online, right? Nike, uh, yeah. I design whatever Id right? I thought, well, Ben's gonna do that. I made a shoe for Ozark. I made, I made a Converse high top with all the symbols from Ozark, from the opening titles. I put those all over the shoe, gave 'em to paid for it myself. Ben could have gone to Nike for free and gotten everybody a pair of Jordans that were just for the cast, just for the crew would've been like a real exclusive thing. That would've been really cool. Yeah. Nothing. Nothing. What did he Nothing do. Did he do anything? It looked like, um, um, uh, pirate booty. I think everyone got a bag of pirate boots. Everybody got a bag of pirates booty. So nothing there. And then, um, by the way, I saw him the other day, those sneakers that your cast loved the sneakers, huh? Yeah, we liked the sneaker. Oh, look, somebody's selling the sneakers that you gave them on the, uh, There it is. Really? Yeah. That's real. We didn't make this up. Jason Bateman rap gift for the fourth final season of the Netflix Cho Ozark. That's a fake look. It's not a fake. And, um, figure out who you gave a size 11 to and narrow it down. 550 bucks. That's pretty small, right? Yeah. Meanwhile you got pirates booty. Yeah. No, that's, um, Damnit. You think that's too low? I think that's low. There's only what, a hundred some pairs of those? Yeah. Sorry. That's terrible. Yeah, but I don't know why I come on this show. I don't know why either. I come out feeling great. You know what? Let's do terrible. Let's take a break. Let's start over again. Let's start over. Let's start over. Fresh the studio. We'll show a clip of your performance in the movie. That would make me feel worse. Jason Bateman is here. The movie is called Air. Hello. Hey, where the hell are you? North Carolina shop. Damnit son. What happened to a phone call? I'm calling you now. I'm in the car. The rental car has a phone in it. It not me, the parent. It would've been unprofessional for me to just call 'em up. Right. He just thought you'd show up at the front door. Look, if anybody back there asked to where I am, just tell 'em I'm sick. You got it Sick in the head. That is Jason. The Which on April are you like kids excited? Do they know about Michael Jordan and. Or is he a shoe to them? My, my 11 year old Maple, she's a huge basketball fan, so she thinks this is really cool. Finally, dad has done something that she can be proud of. Right? She plays basketball. Yeah, she loves basketball. Um, uh, Francesca, who's 16? Couldn't really care less, uh, about a basketball or air. Well, actually it's, she's in, she's into cool shoes. Like, see, I can't wear Jordan's. I don't think anymore. Why? I'm 54 years old. I'd look like, you know, cool dad in, you know, air Jordan. I looked at, uh, maybe just getting the black on black pair, but then I looked like a ref. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, right. White on white. I'm a male nurse, so I can't, I can't get like these fun, colorful shoes. It's, it's over for me. Well, maybe you wear those always our converse around That would be cool. When they cool, you're like, Hey, everybody. Remember the show I was on? Look at my shoes. You know, that would be fun. I can get a, I can get a cheap pair online. You know, I wanted to thank you, uh, for a couple things. You're welcome. First of all, I wanna thank you for the other day when, um, our kids go to the same school. I was crossing the street to get to the school and someone screamed out the window to me. Hey Jimmy, you were great on the Oscars. And I'm like, dang. And then it's him. I felt bad though, cuz you're crossing the street with your daughter and your wife. It's just like, just clowning the guy out the middle of, yeah. Yeah. And then I want to thank you also because, um, so, um, your daughter and our families, you know, we were close, we're friendly, and there was a situation, this was past tense. Did you say past tense? I said we're close, we're friendly, we're close. No, I didn't say we were close, but let me tell the rest of the story. I don't think you even know what story I'm gonna share. It seems like it might be heavy. It's a little bit, it's not that heavy, but. My wife tells me, Hey, listen, uh, your daughter Maple has a, uh, a lizard that she's very fond of. Oh yeah. And my wife says, it's a gecko, bro. It's not a lizard, it's a gecko. Uh, my daughter Jane also thinks this is great, this Gecko. And my wife says, we're gonna watch the Gecko for a week, um, for the abatements. And I said, welcome. Okay, great. Uh, fine. For free, for free. Well, yeah, sure, of course. And then we're headed over to your house to pick up the gecko. We're gonna watch, which should have been my first clue that something was wrong. Because generally when you're doing someone a favor, they will bring the gecko to you. Oh, so wait, was that the way it was sold between Amanda and Molly? I'm sorry that, that, that you were doing us a favor. You're, you're gecko sitting a hundred percent. That's not it. I, I know I said to Molly on the driveway, I said, where are they going? You know? And she's like, oh, they're not going out of town. Well, we're doing Jane a favor. They letting hang out. Huh? You got a dog was the story. Yes, we did get a cute little puppy. You got a puppy and your daughter was distracted by the new dog, right? And so we were gonna watch the gecko while your daughter spent some quality time, which, okay, great. And I'm like, okay, great. So then we get to your house and your wife, Amanda, starts explaining the, you know, how to handle the, get what to do to keep it alive, you know? And she says like, here's the cage and here's the water, and here's the heat lamp. And here's. The crickets. There's like a jar of crickets and um, you gotta feed the crickets to the ggo and whatever. And then she says, and this is where I became a little bit somewhat alarmed, she said, and if you guys go out of town this summer, we'll be happy to watch the Ggo. And I thought why would, what do you mean you'd be happy? This is your gecko. Yeah. You'd be happy to watch your own gecko while we go out of town. At this point, you turned slowly to Molly. I turned slowly to Molly, but I held my tongue and I waited till we get in the car. I'm like, What have happened. Yeah. We are, we are not gecko sitting. We are now adopting a gecko. And now I have a, first of all, crickets smell. Are you aware of that? I didn't know that till Molly hit me with a, with a link this morning. Yeah. Yeah. They don't, they don't smell good. And uh, secondly, I now, like I went into my daughter's room just to check on her in the middle of the night, the other night, and there's this big aquarium with a light on it, and I thought, Oh, we're one of those families whose child has a reptile. Yeah, it's not great. It's not great. Reptile shouldn't be in the house. They should be outside running from an exterminator. Yes, you're totally right. Anyway, I got your present and um, I think you're gonna love it. Is, is it the gecko? It's the gecko, yeah. Son there. He's his name son. He comes with a lot of crickets. I hear. You know, if they get out, then they start, they, they start squi uh, uh, squeaking around the house. You know, you gotta watch out that the crickets don't get out. No, I don't. You have to watch y'all because you, Jason Bateman everybody.

He's a one-time sexiest man alive. Two-time kill monger, and now a three-time heavyweight champion of the world. His directorial debut Creed three opens in theaters Friday. Say hello to Michael B. Jordan. How are you man? I love coming here. You know what? I bet you women start. Screaming whenever you, when you go, like, I bet you women scream at you in the men's room. That would be a little weird, but yeah, that would be weird, but I feel like it would probably happen if it's gonna happen to anybody. It's D Do you ever feel scared? Like when, and I when, I don't mean in general. I mean like, do you ever feel like, oh no, there's too many screaming excited people here. I'd better get out of this a, a little, a little bit. That's why I got my, my man Jarvis, uh, security is, uh, okay. Holding it down. But yeah, I think, you know, when you go certain places, it starts out like maybe one or two, and then the frenzy starts to happen. When people start to start pulling and, and screaming, it becomes a little, a little much. Yeah. Right. Then you just go, I try to calm 'em down like it's okay. Breathe. Breathe, everybody. Breathe, breathe, breathe. And that kind of buys me some time and then I'm outta there. You ever just look up to the heavens and go, God, why did you make me so handsome? I blame my mom and dad. Your mom's in the audience. Tonight. Right. In fact, not always your mom here. Yeah. Your mom. Your mom and my mom are friends. And I just found that out today. I mean, you guys have been hiding this secret relationship for us for how long? A minute. Well, I will say my mother as. Told me all about it. But you Yeah. You didn't know, I guess it was not as big a news in your house. It wasn't mine. Yeah. Yeah. They're friends. They're hanging out. I guess they, they meet up at shows. They're going to see Cordon later on tonight. Watch my brother sitting next to my mom. Oh, your brother's there too, is what's affair. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look at that. So is the whole family, I know you got the premiere across the street tonight. Is the whole family going to the. Premier, this is the first time everybody's gonna see it together, so I'm really, really excited to share it with them. It's a, it's a real personal movie and, uh, it means the world to me. So to get their opinion and see what they think about is gonna be a big one. Now, do you welcome their opinions after the film? All of their opinions. Yeah. For the most part, they, they'll give it to me straight. Okay. They, they, yeah. Yeah. They'll, they'll, they don't, um, they're not yes men at all. They'll, they'll tell me exactly what they think about it. Ha, really, they'll pick the right time to tell me. I see. But they're always gonna tell me the truth. Has your mother ever given you a bad review of anything you did? Oh baby. We'll get 'em next time. Don't you worry. You wanna, you stay off the internet now, don't, don't go on the internet now. You just, you just put your phone down for a couple days and Thanks mom. I got you. Oh, I actually have a question for your mom. Do you, when you are watching these fight scenes, do you get upset watching your son getting punched? And then we'll ask that of my mom as well. It, it's definitely hard to watch. It's hard to watch. It's definitely hard to watch, you know? Wow. The makeup people, they do a wonderful job. So, okay. Now I've kind of come to terms and it's, it's, it's just acting. It's, no, it's not real. He's not getting hurt. Oh, it's acting. I didn't realize that. You gotta keep telling yourself that. Yes, a little bit. This is, I mentioned your, uh, debut as director. Yes, sir. Which is, and I dunno if you look at this kinda stuff, but you know, you're getting very good reviews. You got like 90% on Rotten Tomatoes right now. That's, that's an accomplishment. That's an exceptional number. It is. You look at that not all the time, but. My publicist, they, they, they, they, they manage my, my expectations and my emotions. So they'll, they'll show me a couple good, uh, good reviews every once in a while. Okay. But for the most part, I try not to stay. I try to stay out of, right. Yeah. Yeah, you might. It's nicer to have somebody kind of go through those first just to make sure, you know, it seems like you're pretty safe if you go through them yourself pretty when you are directing something that you're acting in also, which seems very difficult. Do you call other actor directors? Are there people that you can reach out to to get some guidance? Yeah, you know, I've been blessed to work with a lot of great filmmakers over the years and, uh, most recently, like, you know, Denzel Washington, you know, somebody that I spent a lot of time with and just watching, observing and, you know, asking for advice. You know, Bradley Cooper, John Favreau, but um, but um, you call these guys and go like, Hey, tell me what I need to know. Yeah, I wanted to talk to actor directors, Uhhuh, you know, who really like, knew what it was gonna be like right from transitioning from in front of the camera to behind the camera. But, but one thing that Denzel always told me was that, listen, you got a storyboard, storyboard, storyboard. And I'm like, storyboard? Like, what do you, what do you mean? Like, no, I'm gonna get you a storyboard artist. And we were in the middle of rehearsal and he picks up his phone. And he calls this guy and was like, Hey, Warren, it's d. Yeah. Yeah. So remember that kid I was telling you about? Yeah. Well, uh, you know, he's gonna hire you. All right, cool. And he gives me a throne. I'm like, oh, thanks D thank, appreciate that. So immediately start pitching him the movie. And that was my first storyboard artist that I got on CRE three. So that was a, that was a excellent. And was he right? Was that super important when it came to, So crucial. Yeah, just the just shot list and really prepare, you know, what scenes are you gonna actually shoot and what shots that you actually need. Storyboards were, were, were a lifesaver for me. And you have like a comic book about the movie at the end of it, right? I saved all of them. You did? Yeah. Yeah. I saved all of 'em, especially for the fights, you know what I'm saying? I saved all the storyboards that I have. I'm gonna turn it into like a little collage on a, on a wall one day. But uh, yeah, it's memorabilia. Yeah. That's pretty cool. Do you save stuff like that? Are you one of those guys that. Keeps all this kind of stuff. Keep all the gloves, the shorts, the robe, you know what I mean? Certain little things that mean that mean something to a character. I'll, I'll keep it. Yeah. You become like, part of like being in these movies when they're super successful, you become kind of, Part of the boxing world, right? Definitely. Yeah. Like I have a, like for the rest of your life. No, that's it. I, everybody's gonna come up to me like, you know, throwing the punch up, that's gonna be the thing. I used to see Sly do that all the time and I now, I, I get it, you know, people are randomly coming up, smacking up the table. I'm like, I'm trying to eat what's going on. Yeah. Adon is creed. We meet again. I just met you. What are you talking about? But, um, yeah, I, I'm, I'm looking forward to that. It's a big day now. Oh, you have, is this what the, how many premieres have you had for, uh, Creed. Creed. Creed one. We had, uh, Mexico City. Then we had Paris, we had London. We had Atlanta. We in in Chicago. This will be like the fifth or sixth, uh, premiere that we've had so far. Are there more after this? We have one more in Japan. Okay. We got one more in Japan. Yeah, at the end of May. It's my first time going to Tokyo. I can't wait to go. Oh, you never been there? Oh, never been, man. Oh, that's gonna be great. You're a good time. That will be weird to go there and have people know you in a, in a totally different country where it's. It's gonna be cool. I mean, I, I, in my mind, I've been in Japan like numerous times just for my, my love of anime and just like on Instagram, you know, just kind of like being through that. But, uh, I can't wait to go now. I hope this happens in Japan because down the block from us, uh, I don't know if you know, this billboard went up, just went off. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Vin Klein. That's, uh, that's, that's up right now, isn't it? Yeah. That's like just right down the block from us. Uh, have you seen this in person yet? I have not. This is actually the first time I'm seeing it and, you know, just first time I'm seeing it. Did they tell you which picture they were gonna use for the billboards? Not that one. No, but, but it works. It works. It almost looks like your Superman stopped flying Orwell. Wow. What happened? Put him Okay. There you're, then there's more. That's not it. I mean, they really went to town on the photographs. Mama, close your eyes. I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, mama. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Did you know they were taking these pictures when you had your pants off? I consented for this one. This, they had my approval. Are you now wearing Calvin Klein underwear at all times? I mean, you know. You know. Yeah, yeah, you do? Okay, good. Do you have to, did they say, Hey, by the way, you now have to wear Calvin Klein underwear? No, but they're actually extremely comfortable. They're actually, they're actually pretty good. They're pretty good. When you're doing a shoot, like an underwear shoot. Yeah. Which is what this is. You know, you're selling the underwear. I'm supposed, I guess I'm supposed to be trying my, and going like, Hey, I, I'd like to look like that in my underwear, but the reality is, is it's never gonna happen. But do you, do you have like, um, like do you make sure like the room's warm, you know, there's a good muscle blood flow. It's, it's a, it's a closed set, you know what I'm saying? Sometimes it's good to get a good pump right before you go. You know what I'm saying? The muscles. The muscles, the muscle. Course. All the muscles. It's good. It's good. These, these images live forever. You're right. Michael V. Jordan is here as movie three three in my home, bro, you met my family. I put money up for you. Put the gloves on your head. What you add? That's enough. Billy, you, you put the gloves on my hands. Oh, homie, you must be punchy because the memory serves. You used to carry my gloves. Get your and get out the gym. That is Michael B. Jordan, and it be scary. Jonathan Majors in Creed three. It opens the theaters Friday. He's, um, now is it strange to have a guy that you essentially cast and, uh, probably befriended over the course of the movie? And then you guys have to, you know, play an nemesis. You have to hit and you have to hit each other. Yeah. I mean, it, it's, uh, it's actually better that we like each other and we're actually friends because we know we're not gonna take anything personally. I mean, I think if we would've went into it and like, we haven't been cool, or maybe, you know, A punch might have slipped a few more times, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But no, no, but, but he's a great guy, you know, a wonderful actor. Yeah. That really brought a depth and a la a layer of complexity to the character that you just needed to match the, the, the depth of Adonis. You know, you needed to be challenged in a real way, but he did it perfectly. And, uh, you know, it was, it was a great time. Was there ever a moment where one of you hit the other and actually, like you got annoyed? By it. Not really annoyed by it, but we, we, I, I think we got hit, but we used it in the context of the moment. You know what I'm saying? So like one thing when we're boxing, you know, we know the choreo, but when you get tired, sometimes you slip, you left, you're supposed to go right. You know, he's throwing a left punch and then you, he ends up like rocking you, but then you just. Play it off cuz you don't wanna blow a take, you know? Cause you got so many good things in there. So you just kind of roll with the punches, especially when you are the one calling cut. Right. You know? Exactly, exactly. Having to yell action. And it's so much fun to be in there and actually boxing and directing at the same time because you kind of cut out the middlemen of the director. So anything that I'm, I'm, and I'm watching the scene unfold. You are. So if I, while you're doing it well. Exactly. So if I want to continue and without, you know, cutting the pace and like, you know, stopping the action, I could just keep it going and it just, it worked out. It was way more efficient. Have you ever seen those, um, uh, online? They asked the celebrities the most Googled questions about them. I have seen something like that, yes. Well, we have found, um, and this took a long time, the least searched questions about Michael B. Jordan, and I wondered if you might answer a few of these. Let's do it. Um, does Michael B. Jordan love Winnipeg? I don't not love Winnipeg. Is Michael B. Jordan a certified notary public? No. No, he is not. Which part of the macina does Michael B. Jordan like the most?

Okay, cool. Is Michael B. Jordan afraid of clowns? No. No. Okay, good. A lot of people are. Yeah, that would be the moment. That would be the moment. Yeah.

exceptional number it is you look at that not all the time but my publicist they they they they they manage my my expectations and my emotions so theyll theyll show me a couple good uh good reviews every once in a while okay but for the most part i try not to stay i try to stay out of right yeah yeah you might its nicer to have somebody kind of go through those first just to make sure you know it seems like youre pretty safe if you go through them yourself pretty when you are directing something that youre acting in also which seems very difficult do you call other actor directors are there people that you can reach out to to get some guidance yeah you know ive been blessed to work with a lot of great filmmakers over the years and uh most recently like you know denzel washington you know somebody that i spent a lot of time with and just watching observing and you know asking for advice you know bradley cooper john favreau but um but um you call these guys and go like hey tell me what i need to know yeah i wanted to talk to actor directors uhhuh you know who really like knew what it was gonna be like right from transitioning from in front of the camera to behind the camera but but

You know, from a number of great movies, including the Wolf of Wall Street and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, now she goes even further. Back upon a time, the 1920s Hollywood in Damien Chael's, Babylon. It opens at theaters a week from Friday. Please welcome Margo Robby. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing well. I know your mom's in the audience tonight. She's good, huh? Mom, right? How about that? Your mom's right there. There's mom. Hi there. How are you? Welcome. Did you know your mom was coming? Is this a surprise? No, I knew she was coming. Cuz we have the premier, so the premiere. Ah, see she's here for the premiere and then the holidays. Will you guys spend that together? Yes, we will. Very nice. This will be so nice. Yeah. Are you guys like a big holiday family? I, yes, I, I in particular, love Christmas. You do so, so, so much. Yes. When you say you love it, what in particular, like, are you a gift giver? Do you like just the tradition? All of it. Love Christmas food. Love putting up a Christmas tree. I love Christmas music. I love buying gifts. I definitely overdid it this year. I, I have a tendency to like bite off more than I can chew in. This year I decided to make my husband an advent calendar where I'd give him a gift every day, and now it's like December, whatever, like I'm like halfway and I hold on a minute now, struggling the kids. I have this with my kids and it's a little thing. And then you punch out the windows and there's a little like, We have like, uh, Minecraft characters in, in ours. Yeah. So I'm guessing you don't give your husband Minecraft characters? No, I went way more ambitious. But what kind you think? I handmade it, so it's like hanging. I, I burnt myself with a hot glue gun anyways. It's a whole, it's a whole thing. And you did, you you have a hot, and now I hide a present in every day. I, and I'm like up at midnight running around the house trying to hide these presents. And I was like, the present started off. Big and amazing, and now I'm really running out the things to give him. And it's just, Christmas is gonna be such a letdown this year. Cause its just gonna be like, here's a candy cane. I have a hundred questions about this. First of all, does he, is he, does he like getting 25 presents? No, he's very overwhelmed by this whole thing. Yeah, because that's like more presents than like Nick Cannon would get his kids, you know what I'm saying? This is like, it's a huge number of presents. Yeah. Yeah. And then every day he's gotta open a present, go through the whole thing. Yeah. And you're saying you're hiding 'em, so they're not in like, you haven't built like a wall in your home where you're pulling 'em out like little Cub homes, they, they hidden every, I mean, it's Jimmy mean it's so stressful. I I really can't tell you. It's like a triple Hanukkah, what you've set up for yourself. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Wow. That's pretty crazy. Yeah. And then the gifts are you, you know, you're, do you feel like you need to build towards something spectacular? I feel like that would've been a good strategy. I see. But I started so strong and, and now. You know, I'm running outta things to I, like I said, it's just, I've, I, does he, they just get, they're getting smaller as we go. It's Does he get you 25 gifts? No, he's, again, he's overwhelmed by this whole thing. He's like, am I, do I do this next year? Oh, that's poor bastard. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz now, What is he gonna get you now? I mean, after this. I know, I know, but I don't, I don't really care about what gifts. I, I just love this month long celebration. You love g That's how I feel too. I don't even really want gifts. No, no. I like giving the gifts. Yeah. I don't like the, going through the whole process. I love wrapping them. Everything. I just wish I wasn't quite so ambitious with wrapping. I am not involved in, but yes. Yeah, no, I'm not a good rapper. It's really, I'm about as good a rapper as I am a rapper. You know what I'm saying? Okay, so did you have a Christmas party? Uh, I did actually on the weekend. My girlfriends and I, we, we do like a, yeah, like the girls, our girl group does like a Christmas thing. This year, again, I, when I say I love Christmas, it's more like I'm a Christmas tyrant. I, uh, I, I was like, this year we're all gonna dress up like they do a mean girls and learn the mean girls dance. And again, from the movie, the performance of the movie. Yeah, yeah. Super ambitious again, it's, yeah. And then you assign them to learn the dance, and then you come together and do the dance for who are you doing the dance? We, we, you know, The, all the boyfriends and husbands and you know, they all collected together and we, we showed up and did the dance for them and demanded Christmas cocktails and it was a whole thing. This husband of yours really made out, let me tell you something. I dunno what he did in a previous life or something. It must be so stressful being married to me, it's just like, no, no, that's not what I was saying, but yeah. Yeah. Oh, oh, in Australia, Christmas is, uh, like in, in it's summertime. Yeah. It's the, it's the peak of summer, so it's a very different vibe. Christmastime in Australia, I mean, it's, it's wonderful. Just in a different way. It's not what you guys see in the movies. It's not, doesn't feel as festive when it's not cold. So for us, Christmas is going to the beach. It's having prawns and a beer. It's, it's, it's 4th of July. Right, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That is, I guess, very different. But you feel, it's interesting to me because I would think that Christmas would be to you, whatever you experienced when you were a child, and rather you like the winter wonderland type of thing. Yeah, because I've always seen it in movies and I think I've just always fallen in love, in love with what I've seen in movies. When did you learn, and I apologize if this is news to you. Mm-hmm. When did you learn about Santa? What do you mean? Um, I mean, You know what I mean? No joking. Um, yeah, no, I, it's good idea. Remember, I remember looking outta this, um, I remember that day vividly and uh, I dunno what age I was, maybe I was, you know, eight or something like that. And it was, you know, school ground, you know, playground. Everyone told, told me. Somebody told you, somebody told me some little rat told you. I went home and checked with my mom. And, and she didn't lie to my face. She said, that's right. He's not, I'm scared to say it in case any kids are watching this, and I destroy him. Yeah. I don't wanna be that person that does that moment. But it was, it was a very, very sad day because then I, it also, the realization caught up as I was. Saying it that also, that probably meant that the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy Oh, you put that together also? Yeah. It took me a second. Some kids will be like, oh, Santa's not real. Thank God for the Easter bunny. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And by the way, I lost a tooth. I'd like $10. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a lot to find out all at once. Very, yeah. Yeah. That's, uh, I was just like, adults are such liars. They're all in on this lie. Even people on the news talk about Santa, like it's, it's. Everyone's lying. You had that reaction? Yeah. Yeah. I have news for you. You know, um, Lionel Richie is not real. He's a lot of people. He's an imaginary character. He, he's in our, yeah. See, don't ruin this for me too. I can't take it again. Wow. So you really love Christmas. Huh? I love Christmas. And then you got this movie premiere the same weekend, perfect Christmas movie. Anyone wants to, uh, see, that's right. I mean, it kind of is because. It's just so, it's so, it's not Christmasy at all. It's not Christmasy at all. No, no, no. And it's definitely not appropriate for young children. Um-huh. It's Or old children. Really. Or old. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually don't watch it with children. Anyone you're related to. Maybe it's, it's a fun movie though. It's very. Some moments could get awkward, but it's really, really, we're gonna have a look at a clip from it when we come back. We're gonna take a quick break. Margo, Robbie is with us. Her movie is Lon, right Back. Action. Action Moore And on Chest. Guess this, what is going on here? Bar. Look at this. Moore and Tears. Okay. Closer. Um, we seem to be out. What? Haven't used any poor. You thought it was lube. You thought it was lube? Yes. She can't cry. She does some random horror from Wall House. Cut. Hi, uh, I'm Nelly Leroy, so we go on again. That's Margo Babylon. It's open December at the movies. The um, can you do that cry on command like that? I, yeah, I worked on a soap for three years, so that was, well you have to do that in the soap. It was kinda like a muscle li in that time. Yeah. What is the secret to that? I have heard that you have to drink a lot of water just to start, because it's like if you don't have any water and you, nothing's gonna come out. No, no. I just think it's something sad. Oh, you do? Okay. What were you thinking of there? Just probably something sad, like something that might make you cry right now crying and Santa are not being real. Well, now you've blown it. Um, this movie is a crazy movie. I mean, a lot of crazy things are. Give us a little, um, just kind of explain if you would, what's going on. Sure, sure. It's kind of like a, a look at Hollywood a hundred years ago, but it's a very different look. It's, it's Debs and it's decadent and it's. The 19, you know, 1920s, but there comes along sound. So it's the transition from silent films to talkies, which some people were able to, you know, adapt with. And a lot of people, like my character, for instance, a bit of a spoiler, not really, uh, definitely didn't, but it was just Damien's. It's, he's swinging for the face. Damian Chael. Damian Chael is the director. Don La la Land Whiplash. He's an incredible director. We did a Doritos commercial together also. No, really? Oh yeah. It was, it was a really good one. That was amazing. I bet it was. I mean, he is a genius. I, I have no doubt. And then so are you. Um, and so were Doritos Anyways, um, he. He is just swinging for the fences with this movie. It's so, because you big and ambitious and bold and it's just so not the 1920s, like you've seen it on screen before. It's not cute. Flapper girls Charleston. It's like that's crazy. Crazy amount of drugs and orgies and, yeah. Does it's. It's insane. In the movie your character is in like an orgy party. Yeah. Is, um, uh, projectile. Vomits on a person? Yeah. A lot of people. Yeah. A lot of people. Yeah. Um, uh, there's a, a fight. A rattlesnake fight with a rattlesnake. Yeah. And that, have you experienced any I'm actually glad we're having this conversation in front of my mom now, so that she's got a little pre rewarding for She's about to see, cuz she doesn't know what this movie's about. Well now she does. You know, I thought after Wolf of Wall Street, nothing's gonna shock the family. Your mom's probably seen you vomit. You probably vomited on your mom before, right? Uh, I must have maybe when I was really little, but yeah, she says yes. Yes, for sure. Maybe when I was little. Yeah. Actually, I'm glad your mother's here because I was reading something about you and I'm curious about it. Hmm. You sleep with a bunny. Uh, bunny this, what's the Bunny's name? Bunny. Oh, the Bunny's name is Bunny. But when you get a toy when you're zero years old, it's, it's pretty straightforward with the naming process. So you went with Bunny as the name of the bunny, and this is something you had since you, since you were born. I sleep with Bunny every night. Bunny's like my most precious possession. And for real, this is not a joke. No, no. I, it's just, I literally sleep with her every night and actually my mom's the only person I let. Touch her, like fix her. Oh, you know, cuz she gets filthy obviously. So if it's a long time since mom and I have caught up, bunny is looking be dragged and she, like in this picture, look, she needs her cheek stitched up and sometimes she loses her nose a bit and gets a hole anyways. And your mother will repair and wash bunny for you. Look, she's 32 years old, so once upon a time maybe she looked a lot more like a bunny. But this is how she looks now and I love her. Well I was just thinking, so you are a, you know, you're a. Big movie star, uh, and a big movie star should have a big bunny. And so we, we got you something now. And, um, I think it's, it's, yes, it's right over here, so you wanna come check it out. This is, uh, this is Bunny. This is like a, you know, a big, big, big size bunny. And, uh, this is for you. I mean, uh, I don't know if you want to take this, we can send this back to watch. I feel like I'm in, in Donnie Daco right now. This is, yes, this is, I dunno how I feel about this is now I know how I feel about it. I'm terrified. You don't like money. Maybe you feel better if you saw what Bunny was. Look at, look at what's going on here. Oh God no. This is like the Santa conversation all over again. It's just, there you go. All right. Thanks for doing that. Well maybe bake this, uh, present number 25 for your husband. Can I take that home with me? That this is all you running up. Stay where you're right. Bunny's getting a little excited.

love christmas food love putting up a christmas tree i love christmas music i love buying gifts i definitely overdid it this year i i have a tendency to like bite off more than i can chew in this year i decided to make my husband an advent calendar where id give him a gift every day and now its like december whatever like im like halfway and i hold on a minute now struggling the kids i have this with my kids and its a little thing and then you punch out the windows and theres a little like we have like uh minecraft characters in in ours yeah so im guessing you dont give your husband minecraft characters no i went way more ambitious but what kind you think i handmade it so its like hanging i i burnt myself with a hot glue gun anyways its a whole its a whole thing and you did you you have a hot and now i hide a present in every day i and im like up at midnight running around the house trying to hide these presents and i was like the present started off big and amazing and now im really running out the things to give him and its just christmas is gonna be such a letdown this year cause its just gonna be like heres a candy cane i have a hundred questions about this first of all does he is he does he like getting 25 presents no hes very overwhelmed by this whole thing yeah because thats like more presents than like nick cannon would get his kids you know what im saying this is like its a huge number of presents yeah yeah and then every day hes gotta open a present go through the whole thing yeah and youre saying youre hiding em so theyre not in like you havent built like a wall in your home where youre pulling em out like little cub homes they they hidden every i mean its jimmy mean its so stressful i i really cant tell you its like a triple hanukkah what youve set up for yourself yeah exactly exactly wow thats pretty crazy yeah and then the gifts are you you know youre do you feel like you need to build towards something spectacular i feel like that wouldve been a good strategy i see but i started so strong and and now you know im running outta things to i like i said its just ive i does he they just get theyre getting smaller as we go its does he get you 25 gifts no hes again hes overwhelmed by this whole thing hes like am i do i do this next year oh thats poor bastard yeah yeah cuz now what is he gonna get you now i mean after this i know i know but i dont i dont really care about what gifts i i just love this month long celebration you love g thats how i feel too i dont even really want gifts no no i like giving the gifts yeah i dont like the going through the whole process i love wrapping them everything i just wish i wasnt quite so ambitious with wrapping i am not involved in but yes yeah no im not a good rapper its really im about as good a rapper as i am a rapper you know what im saying okay so did you have a christmas party uh i did actually on the weekend my girlfriends and i we we do like a yeah like the girls our girl group does like a christmas thing this year again i when i say i love christmas its more like im a christmas tyrant i uh i i was like this year were all gonna dress up like they do a mean girls and learn the mean girls dance and again from the movie the performance of the movie yeah yeah super ambitious again its yeah and then you assign them to learn the dance and then you come together and do the dance for who are you doing the dance we we you know the all the boyfriends and husbands and you know they all collected together and we we showed up and did the dance for them and demanded christmas cocktails and it was a whole thing this husband of yours really made out let me tell you something i dunno what he did in a previous life or something it must be so stressful being married to me its just like no no thats not what i was saying but yeah yeah oh oh in australia christmas is uh like in in its summertime yeah its the its the peak of summer so its a very different vibe christmastime in australia i mean its its wonderful just in a different way its not what you guys see in the movies its not doesnt feel as festive when its not cold so for us christmas is going to the beach its having prawns and a beer its its its 4th of july right right yeah yeah yeah that is i guess very different but you feel its interesting to me because i would think that christmas would be to you whatever you experienced when you were a child and rather you like the winter wonderland type of thing yeah because ive always seen it in movies and i think ive just always fallen in love in love with what ive seen in movies when did you learn and i apologize if this is news to you mmhmm when did you learn about santa what do you mean um i mean you know what i mean no joking um yeah no i its good idea remember i remember looking outta this um i remember that day vividly and uh i dunno what age i was maybe i was you know eight or something like that and it was you know school ground you know playground everyone told told me somebody told you somebody told me some little rat told you i went home and checked with my mom and and she didnt lie to my face she said thats right hes not im scared to say it in case any kids are watching this and i destroy him yeah i dont wanna be that person that does that moment but it was it was a very very sad day because then i it also the realization caught up as i was saying it that also that probably meant that the easter bunny and the tooth fairy oh you put that together also yeah it took me a second some kids will be like oh santas not real thank god for the easter bunny yeah yeah exactly and by the way i lost a tooth id like 10 yeah yeah yeah it was a lot to find out all at once very yeah yeah thats uh i was just like adults are such liars theyre all in on this lie even people on the news talk about santa like its its everyones lying you had that reaction yeah yeah i have news for you you know um lionel richie is not real hes a lot of people hes an imaginary character he hes in our yeah see dont ruin this for me too i cant take it again wow so you really love christmas huh i love christmas and then you got this movie premiere the same weekend perfect christmas movie anyone wants to uh see thats right i mean it kind of is because its just so its so its not christmasy at all its not christmasy at all no no no and its definitely not appropriate for young children umhuh its or old children really or old yeah yeah yeah actually dont watch it with children anyone youre related to maybe its its a fun movie though its very some moments could get awkward but its really really were gonna have a look at a clip from it when we come back were gonna take a quick break margo robbie is with us her movie is lon right back action action moore and on chest guess this what is going on here bar look at this moore and tears okay closer um we seem to be out what havent used any poor you thought it was lube you thought it was lube yes she cant cry she does some random horror from wall house cut hi uh im nelly leroy so we go on again thats margo babylon its open december at the movies the um can you do that cry on command like that i yeah i worked on a soap for three years so that was well you have to do that in the soap it was kinda like a muscle li in that time yeah what is the secret to that i have heard that you have to drink a lot of water just to start because its like if you dont have any water and you nothings gonna come out no no i just think its something sad oh you do okay what were you thinking of there just probably something sad like something that might make you cry right now crying and santa are not being real well now youve blown it um this movie is a crazy movie i mean a lot of crazy things are give us a little um just kind of explain if you would whats going on sure sure its kind of like a a look at hollywood a hundred years ago but its a very different look its its debs and its decadent and its the 19 you know 1920s but there comes along sound so its the transition from silent films to talkies which some people were able to you know adapt with and a lot of people like my character for instance a bit of a spoiler not really uh definitely didnt but it was just damiens its hes swinging for the face damian chael damian chael is the director don la la land whiplash hes an incredible director we did a doritos commercial together also no really oh yeah it was it was a really good one that was amazing i bet it was i mean he is a genius i i have no doubt and then so are you um and so were doritos anyways um he he is just swinging for the fences with this movie its so because you big and ambitious and bold and its just so not the 1920s like youve seen it on screen before its not cute flapper girls charleston its like thats crazy crazy amount of drugs and orgies and yeah does its its insane in the movie your character is in like an orgy party yeah is um uh projectile vomits on a person yeah a lot of people yeah a lot of people yeah um uh theres a a fight a rattlesnake fight with a rattlesnake yeah and that have you experienced any im actually glad were having this conversation in front of my mom now so that shes got a little pre rewarding for shes about to see cuz she doesnt know what this movies about well now she does you know i thought after wolf

(2023)",Abby Ryder Fortson ,Jimmy Kimmel Live,PG-13,106,"Comedy, Drama","7,256,066.00",Female,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct1llosp4wM,"44,000.00",512.00,817.00,80.00,"Her next guest started acting when she was four. She played an 11 year old when she was 13. She turned 15 in March, which I think I know makes her like 105 years old. I don't know. Her new movie is called, are You There? God? It's me, Margaret. It opens in Theaters Friday. Please welcome Abby Ryder Fortune. Thank you. Well, you came out here. Fast too. I al you almost surprised me. Oh, sorry. I'm a fast walker. Hey, you are a fast. Are you a fast walker? Yes, I am. My entire family has to try to speed to catch up with me. Is that true? Yeah. So on walks, when we take our dog for walks, it's always me in the front with the dog dad in the middle, or maybe in the back sometimes. And Josh is just trailing behind us. My little brother, he's like 10. Uh, he'll, he'll always just be trailing behind us just hanging out. Watching as I speed away with the dog, and I don't even notice that everyone else is just, you have a, you must have like a Greyhound or something. You have a fast dog. Uh, I have a lab, Husky Shepherd Retriever, Newfoundland Boxer Mix. Wow. Yeah. He's a rescue, so, yeah. And well, you're able to analyze him and find out that Yeah, we got, we got one of those DNA tests. Oh, you did? Yeah. Those were super, those are super cool. Yeah, they are cool. You know, you can do 'em on humans too. Yeah. I found out that I was a half Italian, a half Pomeranian. Yeah. That's pretty cool. Yeah, it's pretty. Yeah. Did you know, and now I know you were 15 years old, right? Yeah. Did you know about this book from uh, I mean, so this book, when I was a kid was a big, very big deal. Yeah. You didn't know about it, did you? So I was, I'm a super avid reader. I, I've read, I've been reading since I was pretty much old enough to walk. My parents have been reading to me, but for some reason Judy Bloom and I just missed each other. I guess. I was like super into sci-fi and fantasy when I was younger. Yeah. So I, I I never read, are You there? God, to Be Margaret, until I got the audition to play. Margaret in the movie. Did you tell Judy Bloom this? Have you met Judy Bloom? Yes, I've met Judy Bloom. She was on set for a good couple of weeks, but, well, how old is Judy Bloom now? I wanna say 84. Okay. All right. I don't know, I, I don't, I don't try to make a habit of looking up people's saying when you walk with her, is she fast enough? Is she, um, no, I think, I think I have just so down a little bit for her. Did she, um, so she was there or did she like, I don't know, did she have tips? Did she weigh in on what you guys were doing? So the biggest thing that I think her note was when we were on set is that we, when we were rehearsing one of the scenes where all of the girls start doing, they must increase our bust little exercise. Her biggest note. Oh yeah. Right. Yeah. Remember that guys? You know, I remember that from like Laverne and Shirley or something. Yeah. So, Right. Her biggest thing, we must, we must increase our bust. Right? Yeah. Little, little song. Little song and dance. Um, the her biggest note was that when we, while we were rehearsing Kelly, the way that she had always envisioned it was, you would clasp your hands and do I must, I must, I must increase your bust. Uh, so that's how she envisioned it. But apparently according to Judy, the way that she and her friends used to do it was always more like, I must, I must, I must increase my bus. It was done in a more lighthearted way. Yeah. In a more lighthearted way. You know? Really works those arm muscles though. Wow. After doing it for about four months with hundreds of takes each, you know, you really, I got some biceps uhhuh. Yeah. It's really good. Yeah. Did you really do hundreds of takes of that? Yeah, I mean, if you combined every single scene that we had to do that in, and then plus all of the different camera angles and all that. Yeah. Probably someone should count that up, honestly. Yeah. You know, Gamel, would you mind counting that up? Get, um, have you, you said you like sci-fi and stuff, like how, how, you said you read a lot, how many books would you read in like, I don't know, a year or something? Um, 365. I don't know. Will you read a book every day? I, I try to. Honestly, every day you read a whole book. I read really, really fast. I, I think I Oh, you walk fast. You read fast. Yeah. I'm, I'm a very high speed person and I, have you ever thought of slowing down a little? See, I'm trying to save that for when I get a little older. You know, there's, there'll be time to slow down. Eventually I'll. I'll buy a nice home, relax with a couple of cats, all my plants that I've named, and I refer to them as my children. And I've kept like about 15 alive, you know, all the good stuff. You have plants now, or this is what you're envisioning for yourself? I have tons of plants in my room. Oh, you do? I I steal them from oth other people in the house and I keep them alive because they always kill them. So it's like a jungle in your bedroom. Oh yeah. Yeah, 100%. And you've been acting since you were a little kid. Yeah. So, so, and did you love it immediately? Honestly. Yeah, I, I remember when. So my parents are both actors. They're right over the head. Your parents are actors? Yes. Okay. They're all right. This is when you learned to leave? Yes, I parents, yes. Did you know they were gonna be here? Uh, yes, I did. You did? Okay. We, we discussed it beforehand, so, uh, yeah, so they're both actors and they used to take me to their auditions with them, and I would sit on the producer's couch and I just watched them. And one day when I was, I think about like three and a half or something, I just turned to them and I was like, I wanna do this now. Please get me an audition. I wanna be an actor. You know what's funny? I was just looking at your parents. I think they were probably too young for this when this book came out. Even so when you're on the set, the movie set in the seventies, right? Yes. Does everything seem weird to you? Like the seventies stuff, the props and decorations and all that stuff? Actually, no. I'm a huge, like, vintage person. I have, I have vinyls records, everything like that, and I, it, it, it is really, really cool to be on a 70 set though, cuz it's like stepping into a time machine every single day. You're on set. It's so, it's so amazing. Like what objects in particular jumped out at you? See my favorite, I have to say my favorite is actually a rotary phone. Really? Because really, here's the thing. When you, and nowadays y'all got your cell phone, and when you, when you're really mad at someone and you really just wanna hang up on them, pressing that end call button just doesn't make the same clank. You're right. Plank. Right. You know, it's not the same. I practiced a couple times on the set we had, um, on the phone that we had on set. It was really fun. You know, I, I, I would love to say that I miss it, but I wasn't alive. There. Yeah. No. Yeah. You missed it is what happened. Yeah. You missed it entirely. But it also, it was no fun and somebody had a lot of eights in their number. It's like you were exhausted by the end of it. It really was. So, but you write the slamming down. Yeah, I quit. Yeah. Now it's like I quit. Have you seen the movie in a theater with an audience yet? I've seen the film four times and then at the premiere, that's when, that's the first time I thought with a really big audience. Um, and it was, it was so, so cool. I mean, just, just sitting in a theater and having everyone laugh at the exact same moment and, you know, cry and we're all experiencing something together. That's the magic about movies. Honestly. Your parents saw it. Yes, they did. My mother started sobbing. Three minutes in. It was, we weren't even past the opening titles yet. And she was just sitting there bawling, crying. She was like, oh my God, my daughter's moving. Um, she had already seen it three times at that point, and she was so crying. Yeah, but it's, you know, you could, well I MIAs you couldn't understand that because you're 15 years old and you. Think your plants are your children, but one day maybe you'll be in a movie theater and you'll look up and you'll see your fern up on. That's stream isn't, you'll see your a Rud dendron perhaps, and you'll be like, oh, it's my sweet little sapling. Yes, exactly. Well, congratulations. I have a feeling this is gonna be a big deal. My cousin Mickey is like, this is like a big book from her life. When she went and saw the movie and said, you guys. Really, uh, did Judy Bloom Justice? And I know Judy waited a long, like she was, she never let anybody, I think Betty White wanted to play this role that you're playing. That's how long they've been waiting to make this movie. So anyway, congratulations. The movie is cold. Are you there? God, it's me, Margaret. It opens the theaters Friday. Abby Rider Fortune, everybody. Thank you Abby.

Yesterday she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and she returns to the role of death dodging a reporter. Gil Weathers in Scream six. It opens in theaters March 10th. Please welcome. Courtney Cox. Congratulations, by the way. Thank you. That's pretty exciting to get your star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I can't believe you didn't have it already. Me too. No. Um, it was really, Exciting. It was, I, I didn't even know how big of a deal it was until I got there. And this one, uh, reporter said to me, how does it feel that you have a star? And to think that Coco's kids will just have it for everyone, walk on it. And I went like, oh, wow. Um, that is beautiful. And yet that means. I'm actually gonna die. I like that. So many mixed emotions about it. Yeah, it kind of is a little bit of a headstone too, isn't it? Right. It's like both of those things. Yeah. Coco, of course, is your daughter. Did your fam the whole family come out for this? Did they come back from back home? Um, well, Johnny came out from London. Your boyfriend John? Yeah. Uhhuh. And, uh, my sister Virginia came out and my other sister, Dottie. Yeah. Nice. Very good. My brother didn't, but. Okay. All right. But so you had a pretty good turnout for Yes. This event. Mm-hmm. You, uh, my wife actually was there. I know. I'm sorry. I wasn't there. I was not able, I, I know it's only down the block, but I was not able to get there. Um, but no, I had, I had some things going on, but, um, You, uh, my wife comes home last night and she says like, oh my God, you gotta hear what happened there. But will you tell the story about like, when you, the time you decided to give up? Oh, okay. Yes. Yeah. Um, well, I, my, my dad thought I should give up. Really what happened was I. Hadn't worked in a long time, and I only had enough money to live about two weeks. I mean, really eat like that was it. And um, so I was talking to my dad and he is like, Cece, that's my nickname. You need to come home. You, uh, it's a long fall from Los Angeles to Birmingham, and it's just time to pack it in. And you are a salesman. You're a damn good salesman, and you need to do what you do best. What did he want you to sell? Sell. Swimming pools. Swimming pools. Yep. That's my dad's business. Okay. And by the way, I am pretty good at that. So Yeah, I would imagine you would be. Yeah. So I mean, I knew I had that as a fallback, but I was like, dad, and then the next day I, I got a call saying the audition, I'd gone on for family ties. I got the part as Michael j Fox's girlfriend for the last two years. Was your dad when, when you said, oh, second, uh, change of plans, I'm not coming home, was he bummed out that you weren't coming home? No, no, he was excited. He, I mean, he loves me, but he, I mean, he maybe missed me, I'm not sure. But he loved Hollywood. He loves movies and he loves television. Anything to do with that? We watched movies every the same one, Ben, her, and, um, all those action movies. Um, I forgot about. I can't think of anything. Yeah, well, yeah, just obsessed with, and the same ones over and over. So now you tell this story and moments later this happens. I also wanna thank my beautiful sister's Dottie in Virginia for showing up for me today. Flying in here. My mom would've loved this so much, but my dad was a. Seth. Wow. Sorry guys. Wow. If that isn't a message from the pool business above, I don't know what is that was app was meaningful, but it's true. It's like you could one person who is very intuitive and then she's really kind of crazily intuitive. She immediately went, that's her father. And I know Molly, she felt it too. It was like, I don't even know if Molly believes in that stuff, but your wife. It's hard to ignore when something like that happens at a moment like that. It really is. Yeah. Yeah. Was the timing was, well, you saw it. I mean, it was weird. Yeah, it's pretty weird. And who did that water dump onto? Oh, the pop? No, uh, right. The papa dumped it on the rati is what happened. Yeah. Your, uh, friends, uh, from friends, uh, were at the star ceremony. There's Lisa and Jennifer, and then Laura, who was not one of the cast of friends, but, um, they spoke on your behalf and, um, and guess what? Their stars are so close. Laura is about 10 feet from Jennifer, and I'm about. 20 feet from them. Yeah. Well that's nice to be in that neighborhood. Yeah. It's so sweet. Okay, so, uh, the Scream, this is the sixth Scream movie. Yeah. Hence the title Scream six. Yeah. Ever think about calling it still screaming or anything like that? I mean, it's a good idea. Scream on anything. No, that was a good one. I, we should, when you were reading one of these scripts, because I think like, um, I don't know. Most everybody who was in the other movies is dead. Right. Killed by the, you know the guy, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this new relaunch, there are, uh, there were four people that made, well, not me, I made it two five. Five people that made it from the last one. Okay. Um, and then they brought back Kirby Hayden Panier. Uh huh. Um, she, I, I actually thought she died. I don't even know what scream that was, but uh, when you do this mini, you can't keep up. Yeah. Also, on the show heroes, her character died over and over again, but kept coming back to life. Okay. Yeah. So that's probably what's confusing you. Um, do you go through, when you get the script, and I assume they send you the script, it's all done, right? Mm-hmm. Do you go through and skip to quickly to see if you are dying in the script? Absolutely. You do. First thing you do is just. Did you make it? Um, yeah. The thing is, is that I can't say whether I live or die. And I love asking people, what do you think happens to Gail? And people are so certain. Um, but I don't really read after my character is not in the script, whether she lives or dies, I don't really wanna know what happens, so I don't read it, and then I get to go on the set and go, Hmm. Are you just being a good actor or are you good at acting to be an actor? Like you can't tell that. You know what I mean? Is that a normal thing to do? I All right. I don't always do that. I do read Uhhuh all the time. I take my work seriously. But it's really fun to go see the movie and not have any idea. Yeah, sure. But unless you're in it. You know, I mean, that's our, you know, that's, that's like our thing. And then your thing is being in it. Yeah. Yeah. I trust, well, we have a clip from the movie and, uh, wait, where do you see this? Looks like you're not gonna be able to stop this. Is it fun to shoot something like that? Yeah. I wonder what happened. Was that cast iron, was that a real cast iron pan? Uh, no. No? Okay. All right. It was heavy though. I, you know, it's so weird. They have these knives and Yeah, of course they're not real. It's too dangerous. And I'm like, dude, that's not retractable. He's still stabbing his, they're still lying. Yeah, I know. It hurt no matter what. Yeah. They're relatively dangerous no matter what they tell you or they really are never listen to anybody really. If smart, if I hit you in the head with even a big rubber, it, it's kind of hurt. Please don't do that. Yeah. Okay. You, um, you know, my wife is your number one customer at, uh, with your, uh, candles and your soap and your lotions and all this, whatever stuff you have there. So Sweet. Yeah. With your home court products, and this is kind of exciting, we found this baby. Not really. We didn't find a baby, but we have a, there's a baby on TikTok who smells candles. This baby's name is Sunday. She smells candles and then she instantly reviews them. She decides whether she likes the, well show the baby. Here we go. Are you ready to smell some candles? Yes. Okay. No, no, not dad. Okay. Do you like this? No. Oh my gosh. All right, so this is a very cute baby. Obviously what we did is we sent her your, for your candles. Okay? So, and we asked her, would you like to see Sunday's review of your candles? Well, let me ask you, does she like, once she says no, does it go out of business? I can't imagine. It's good for the candles. This is a, this is the most, how many followers does she have? This is the most powerful baby in the candle industry. Okay. She could literally ruin you. But I promise this is not set up. These are the baby's real reactions. We didn't collude with the baby. All right. First candle is this one called Steeped Rose. All right. Hi Amy. Hi, rose. Yes, yes, yes. Deep Rose Grows. That's a winner. The next one is called Na Leaf. Okay. What's in a roll leaf? It's an orange blossom. Sounds like weed. What you. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. You two for two so far. Wait, did she say what else? That was a like a maybe. I think. What else is, she just wants to keep the candles coming. Okay. Oh, yes, what it is. She's busy. Got it. Next one is, uh, CPR Mint. Or CPR Cyprus. It's just a nice way to, what's spelled? C I P R? Yes. No, no, you're right. It's just that it sounds bad. Did the baby spell these too? Let's take a look. Right? Here you go. Uhoh. Yes. No, no. Put it right there. Yes. Sorry Courtney. You get an upside down for that. And finally, uh, your nickname Cici. Here we go, Lucy. That was, yes, that was very definitive. You know, be funny. We should get that baby and smell the diaper and then give it a yes or a no. All right. When we come back, we have something very special. I know you're very sporty. We saw you running around in the Scream movie. I know you like sports. I know you like to compete. When we come back, we're gonna play. This is a real game. This is a real sport. It's televised in everything. It's called Extreme Indoor Balloon, and we come back.

I mean, who wouldn't be excited for cocaine? Bear. When they come on, when they called you and pitched you on this idea, did they know what the title was gonna be? I mean, honestly, the title, they actually made this movie and kept that title of, of course, it's so good. They had to I know. It's so good. And when Liz pitched it to me, I mean, it was like the height, Liz Banks who directed it. Um, it was the height of Covid and just like the seriousness and the whole world was broken. And I was like, what movie are you making? But you know what, that's exactly why I said yes, because it was like the only movie to make during that time. It hits you just in exactly the right way. If there, if there were awards for movie titles, which by the way, there should be, this would be it. This would be the winner of the decade probably. I know. I love that Everyone's, you know, it's award season and I love that we're here promoting. Cocaine back and like, well, unfortunately it's out of the window of eligibility for the Oscars this year, but next year for sure, who knows? I'm gunning for it. I was thinking about it. I was thinking, I think there were only two other movies whose titles fall in this category. One of course, being snakes on a plane, which was like when you heard tell you like, well, yes, I'm definitely gonna see that. Got it. Yeah. And then there was Sharknato, which was a TV movie. I have no idea what that is, but yes. You don't know what Sharknato is? No. No. Oh, wow. But I'm gonna know what it is. Wow. Well, it's about, um, a tornado that had sharks in it and the tornado would strike, and then people would be eaten by the sharks. Oh yeah. That's, oh, you don't know charna. That's no scary and ex. Sighting. You don't have the, you don't have a basic cable subscription, huh? The world premiere of the movie was last night, right? Yes. We went to the premiere. Yeah, downtown la. How was it? How did it go? It was great. You know how in premieres a lot of times people, the actors have seen it and screenings or whatever. So you go to dinner or something with your friends? Yeah, they come, they walk the red carpet and then they make a hard left turn and go to dinner. We're like, see ya. Um, but. This is such a movie that you do want a communal, ecstatic, crazy experience right in the theater. So banks, we were like, we've gotta go see it with the crowd. And it was so fun to see it in this huge crowd of people. I, I mean, it goes there, this film, you know, there are kids. 12 year olds finding cocaine. Yes. In, yeah. In the woods and doing it. Yes. Yes. Yeah. That's, uh, yeah. Yeah. That's one of the crazy things that happens. Yeah. There's a lot of, a lot of, um, bear eating people. I don't know what I, it is so gory and so crazy and so ridiculous and fun. Was anyone not high in the theater last night? I hope not. Will you go see it now? That's a Hollywood premiere. It's a little bit different than a regular. Yeah. Will you go see it in a real theater with moviegoers? I am bringing a pack of a wild teenagers to my Brooklyn Theater on Friday night. You are? And I want like people talking back. I want people. Drunk people going, oh my God, he's eating his face off. Like, I want all of that. Have you ever experienced a movie like that before? You've never been in a movie like that before, right? Um, no. Like that's just wild. Felicity was a little different than that. Yeah. It's not a little different. Not Felicity esque. No. A little different. Who are the teenagers? You're bringing your own. I bring my son Uhhuh and a, a pack of his friends and, um, Some of the moms, which the kids call us. Moms gone wild. Oh really? Yeah. Why do they call you that, I guess? Cuz we're wild. You're gone wild. Yeah. Do you really go wild? We go like, what's wild? We, well, uh, I think Matthew, my, my partner would say, um, you know, like, we, we meet at like 11 for a beer and then I go, I'll, I'll be back and I'll, I'll make dinner, whatever at five. And then he calls my friend Molly and goes, Around seven and he says, Hey, is is Carrie coming home or is I expect her in a couple days or is she coming home for dinner? It just happens to, I see. It escapes us. I see. Time escapes. Moms work hard. Do you come home when you get that call or do you Yeah, race home drunk on my bike. I see. Is that legal to ride a bike drunk in Brooklyn? It is In Brooklyn. It is, yeah. What's the, um, what's the biggest movie premiere? Because you've been in some really big movies. What's the biggest one you've been to? I feel like, um, Mission Impossible was like the biggest Oh, right. Yeah. Back when the movies were like big, you know, everyone's things are different now. Where was that movie premier? Um, I think the premiere was in Ro well, it was many places, Uhhuh, but the first big one was in Rome and it's, you know, a giant Tom Cruise movie. I was barely in it. I died pretty quick. Um, epic Death though. Um, and they, the way it works is for those giant premieres they like, um, They go to multiple cities every, every day you're in a new city. And so they, a lot of people, actors bring like a makeup artist and a stylist. And I was like, ah. I, I don't want any of these people. I don't know. I'm, I'm gonna bring like my boyfriend. Mm-hmm. So I brought my boyfriend instead of like one of those people. And it was so fun. And we went to Rome and I have to admit, Tom Cruise was very nice to my carpenter boyfriend. Oh, really? Spent all this time talking to him. Yeah. He's always nice to everybody. I mean, he really is like, he was so nice and. But it was crazy. It was such a big premiere that even like, um, other than the giant premiere, the night before, you have a different big party. And it was like at some place where we, I was sitting there on this like weird sofa and Phillips seamer Hoffman was there cause he was in that movie too. And these crazy naked dancers came out with like painted, uh, body makeup and they were crawling like cats and Phillips looking at each other. He just kept going. This is fantastic. This is fantastic. Got light to appreciate, uh, what's going on around you? Yeah, that's pretty crazy. I would've thought Star Wars was the, was would've been your answer. I mean, star Wars was amazing. I mean, it, it was so cool. We, we, one of the big premieres was in London cuz they shoot, you know, Pinewood right there. And, um, one of my mom's gone wild, uh, pals. Andrea was like a big, she's a coder, so she's like big, you know, star Wars fan from a young age and. I was like, you've gotta come to the premier. So they flew, you brought 'em all a wild mom to the, to the premier. I brought a couple, I brought two. My mom's gotten wild and um, at one point had this fancy premiere, Bob Ier, who's the, this handsome, very amazing head of Disney. Yeah. He wrote, um, powerful guy. Yeah. I look over and one of my mom's gone wild, or I think both of them are talking to Bob Iger at the bar, and I was like, Ooh, ooh. Um, raining in ladies rain and in They were great. They were no trouble. No, no trouble that I know of. Yeah, they, other than Bob, they behaved themselves. They behaved themselves. All right. Absolutely pleased. Yeah. Wow. I gotta get in this mom's town. Wild group. It's a good, sounds like there's a lot of. Fringe benefits there. It's a good group. Good group. We're gonna take a break when we come back with See You Clip from um, could be the movie of the year. Cocaine Bear. I think. So. Carrie Russell is McKendry. Have you ever done cocaine? What? Why do you ask? Just wondering if it is long-term side effects for the bear. Of course, it just did a little bit. Well, it could create a habit for the bear. What if they never want to do it again? Oh, then it, it should be fine. But Mama Bear and Papa Bear will be very angry because drugs, especially cocaine, are very, very bad. What if they would never find out? Oh, Henry. We always find out that's true. Henry, remember that Henry, Carrie Russell is here. That is a aless scene from Cocaine Bear kid. How old's that kid? Little, little too young to be young. Cocaine. Yeah, definitely too young for cocaine. Yeah. Did he have any idea what was going on about that? About any of this? Will he see the movie, do you think? I'm sure they'll see. The movie, he wasn't invited to. The premier. It's rated r and i I I do understand that I'm taking my 15 year old to a rated R movie. Yeah, but you're allowed to. Right. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so. With, if you're with a parent you can go see the Yeah, yeah. Either way you're not gonna, probably won't get arrested all if you do be great publicity. They would, it would, it would be really good. Brooklyn, I'm like, he can see this movie you being let away. It's based on. And I know this is gonna sound like a joke, but it's basically loosely on a true story and, and the true story part of it, which is like the drug drop gone bad in the woods and the, and the, they dropped drugs and then the guy ends up killing him. So, or dying, um, Matthew actually plays in the movie. Mm-hmm. I'm sorry. My partner Matthews, Matthew Matthews. Your husband Matthews, yep. Your partner And, yeah. And, uh, He, what happened when banks told me about the script, we were getting all ready. We shot it in Ireland because Covid Alright. I Ireland too. Okay, great. Um, we, we shot it there because Covid numbers were really low there. They had done good job and um, so we were all getting ready to go and Matthew was reading it, thinking it was so funny, and he said, Hey, who's playing this guy at the beginning? And I said, I don't know. And he goes, text banks and tell her, uh, I wanna play that part. And I was like, okay. And he goes, no, text her right now. Like I wanna play it. So I texted her and she said, okay, bye. Wow. So she sent the other actor home. Yeah. Yeah. And Margo Martindale, who is also on the Americans With You, is has a big part in the Margo as well. I feel like it's MVP of this movie. She is the best thing of the whole movie. And so when banks told me about it, um, that same day, Margo texted me and said, Are you doing this movie? And I was like, are you doing this movie? Like, what is, and I'm like, now I'm definitely doing this movie. Yeah. And so it was Margot and I and Matthew and Jesse, Tyler Ferguson being so stupid. Yeah. Jesse is funny in it too. Yeah, in the woods. I mean, we were having so much stupid fun doing dance routines in the woods. Just me trying to not pee my pants in that pink jumpsuit. And your, uh, kids, I know you're taking 'em to see this, but have, have they seen your other stuff? Like do they, have they ever watched Felicity or, so I have, uh, a 15 year old boy. I have a 11 year old girl, and I have a six year old boy and my daughter, like about a year ago. I, and she's kind of mature for her age, and I thought, and she was kind of bored one day and I said, Hey, you know, Willa. I, I, I did the show about this college girl, and you might think it's cool. It's really sweet. And, and so I showed it to her. I put it on and I like downloaded an episode from Amazon or wherever you get it these days. And she was like, um, after about 15 minutes, she turned it off and she's like, Ugh, mom, that's so cringey. Oh, really? Really? She's actually grossed out by me. Interesting. I, that's weird. I was like, I was like, oh, I thought might like it. She's like, oh. So cringey. I guess it might as well have been titled like, mom in College or something like that. Like, I don't, why would you think I would wanna watch your college experience making out with weird boys? Stuff. Yeah, I guess that would be weird. Yeah. And well, speaking of, does she know you were in the Mickey Mouse Club? Is that more her speed? Is that classic? It's a classic, guys. Um, I feel like she might like that. I feel like she might, she's never seen that. I don't think so. It's so crazy. All these people, you and, uh, what? Justin Timber. Britney Spears and Ryan Gosling. Like actually talented people were in it. Yeah. Well, other than me, like he literally talented people. Well, let's not sell yourself short. Carrie, I get it. I get it.

brooklyn it is yeah whats the um whats the biggest movie premiere because youve been in some really big movies whats the biggest one youve been to i feel like um mission impossible was like the biggest oh right yeah back when the movies were like big you know everyones things are different now where was that movie premier um i think the premiere was in ro well it was many places uhhuh but the first big one was in rome and its you know a giant tom cruise movie i was barely in it i died pretty quick um epic death though um and they the way it works is for those giant premieres they like um they go to multiple cities every every day youre in a new city and so they a lot of people actors bring like a makeup artist and a stylist and i was like ah i i dont want any of these people i dont know im im gonna bring like my boyfriend mmhmm so i brought my boyfriend instead of like one of those people and it was so fun and we went to rome and i have to admit tom cruise was very nice to my carpenter boyfriend oh really spent all this time talking to him yeah hes always nice to everybody i mean he really is like he was so nice and but it was crazy it was such a big premiere that even like um other than the giant premiere the night before you have a different big party and it was like at some place where we i was sitting there on this like weird sofa and phillips seamer hoffman was there cause he was in that movie too and these crazy naked dancers came out with like painted uh body makeup and they were crawling like cats and phillips looking at each other he just kept going this is fantastic this is fantastic got light to appreciate uh whats going on around you yeah thats pretty crazy i wouldve thought star wars was the was wouldve been your answer i mean star wars was amazing i mean it it was so cool we we one of the big premieres was in london cuz they shoot you know pinewood right there and um one of my moms gone wild uh pals andrea was like a big shes a coder so

than bob they behaved themselves they behaved themselves all right absolutely pleased yeah wow i gotta get in this moms town wild group its a good sounds like theres a lot of fringe benefits there its a good group good group were gonna take a break when we come back with see you clip from um could be the movie of the year cocaine bear i think so carrie russell is mckendry have you ever done cocaine what why do you ask just wondering if it is longterm side effects for the bear of course it just did a little bit well it could create a habit for the bear what if they never want to do it again oh then it it should be fine but mama bear and papa bear will be very angry because drugs especially cocaine are very very bad what if they would never find out oh henry we always find out thats true henry remember that henry carrie russell is here that is a aless scene from cocaine bear kid how olds that kid little little too young to be young cocaine yeah definitely too young for cocaine yeah did he have any idea what was going on about that about any of this will he see the movie do you think im sure theyll see the movie he wasnt invited to the premier its rated r and i i i do understand that im taking my 15 year old to a rated r movie yeah but youre allowed to right yeah i think so yeah i think so with if youre with a parent you can go see the yeah yeah either way youre not gonna probably wont get arrested all if you do be great publicity they would it would it would be really good brooklyn im like he can see this movie you being let away its based on and i know this is gonna sound like a joke but its basically loosely on a true story and and the true story part of it which is like the drug drop gone bad in the woods and the and the they dropped drugs and then the guy ends up killing him so or dying um matthew actually plays in the movie mmhmm im sorry my partner matthews matthew matthews your husband matthews yep your partner and yeah and uh he what happened when banks told me about the script we were getting all ready we shot it in ireland because covid alright i ireland too okay great um we we shot it there because covid numbers were really low there they had done good job and um so we were all getting ready to go and matthew was reading it thinking it was so funny and he said hey whos playing this guy at the beginning and i said i dont know and he goes text banks and tell her uh i wanna play that part and i was like okay and he goes no text her right now like i wanna play it so i texted her and she said okay bye wow so she sent the other actor home yeah yeah and margo martindale who is also on the americans with you is has a big part in the margo as well i feel like its mvp of this movie she is the best thing of the whole movie and so when banks told me about it um that same day margo texted me and said are you doing this movie and i was like are you doing this movie like what is and im like now im definitely doing this movie yeah and so it was

Magic Mike's last dance opens in theaters a week from Friday. Please say hello to Selma Haino. How are you? It's very good to see you. It's very good to see you too. It's very good to see you too. Yes. We got a nurse in the audience in case anything weird happens. Um, speaking of nurses, Guillermo, you know Guillermo, I know like Lubbock Powell. I was texting with him today because he is got Covid no right now. Oh wow. Yes, and uh, but he's fine. He said he's feeling just fine. He said it's like just sniffles, but, so he's fine. He's feeling fine. He just didn't wanna show up for work. Well, he can't come. If he has covid, we can't risk him infecting you. If I were you, I would make sure he passes the test and show. I know. Yeah. Well he was very bummed that you were gonna be here without him and he actually. I said, oh, well, text me a note and I will read it, um, to Salma. And he wrote, oh boy, Salma, that worst thing of being sick is not being able to see you and say hi, or take a tequila shot with you. I wish you that best for you and your wonderful family. See you at that Oscars. Okay. Okay, let's do that. Will you be at the Oscars? I don't know. Maybe I, we, maybe Boots got nominated for best animated feature. You should be there. But I play a, an animated cat. Yeah. Is that enough excuse to go to the Oscar response? I don't think you need an excuse. I hope not. Nominated. I play an animated card, but I love the film. I love the film. I might, I must show up anyway. Yeah, why not come? I have a dress. I don't know what to do with it. I don't know where to take it. Now let's go through the, oh, you got the dress already. Why not where Sure. Come to, you know, I was looking at a picture. I have this great photograph, uh, from 2017 when I was hosting the Oscar. I remember, and there was a mix up at the end as you probably, I am terrified because you're doing it again. God knows what's gonna happen. Oh. But I was very excited. What? I like what an electrical moment. No, 1979. In fact, we have a photograph. Here's, let's look at that. No. Yeah. 17. Let's zoom in on Selma here, because this is while it was happening and you were, you seen, but you know, I saw it coming. I saw it happening before it happened. Uhhuh. Oh, you did? Yes, because the guy that was in the aisle, one of those people that are like, yo, what's up? Okay. Yeah. I'm gonna go get the comma over there. I just, everybody was looking and I just see him go, what? But what do I do? What do I do? I can't. I can't. I can't tell them I can't go up on stage. No, somebody has, has to do it. Please don't make me go up in the middle. What do we do? We go to convert. No, he was so nervous. And I said, oh, this is not the righter before I knew this is not the right winner. Yeah. So, yeah. And then let's look around here and, uh, look at some of the other, um, there's Robinson, Wayne Johnson, but it was hilarious. He loved it. Who else do we have there in, uh, Merrill St. Street, Denzel Washington. Merrill's really taking it kind of hard. Um, and uh, we have, uh, oh, those two creeps. Look at those. I mean, Mel Gibson looks, I mean, Matt, of course, he does only cares about himself, so he's, uh, yeah, that was a crazy moment right there. So, do you like going to award shows? Is this something that you enjoy? I enjoy part I, I enjoy almost everything. What I don't enjoy is getting on the stage. You don't, because I have the very bad, a very bad case of stage fright. Is that true? Cuz you always seem super relaxed. I'm surprised by that. But in the morning I had diarrhea. I threw up right before I got on the stage. My mouth goes completely dry. I need to. There is no water that can satisfy the thirst. So I have to do the means. The tequila does help, though it doesn't take away the drama, but I didn't need the shot of tequila once, like I'm about to go out, I really need to go to the bathroom to pee. I dunno why my bladder really gets very nervous about it. Wow. And so, yeah, and then I call my, I'm like, Good evening ladies. Didn't something happen with Michael Keaton? You were presenting? Oh yeah. What was that again? I was presenting and, um, Okay. I present and, and I keep saying when they go to the video, I keep saying to myself, it's a lots over. You're good, you're good, you're good. You just read the winner and then you're outta here. And I'm always praying that their speeches are short uhhuh, because even though I'm not talking, I'm like still on the stage you have to stay there. Yeah. And this guy and the winner is Michael Kitten. He went to the bathroom or he, I don't know, maybe he had diarrhea too. And I'm baby, you know, and I'm standing there in Michael Kitten come Michael. And there's this silence every, everybody staring at me. He's nowhere to be fine. And then I don't remember where I said something like, Oh my God, please, I have sex, right? Whoever, somebody come and get this and he must have heard me and he finally showed up and he's walking like a cat, like nothing. Taking his. Time. I'm like, and then he gets on the stage and he decides to do like a summer, so like a roll. And I'm like, dude, get over here already. Oh, you got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame since the last time you were here. And I'm always interested when you, when that happens, you pick somebody who's like important to you to present the, to speak about you beforehand. Who did you pick to speak about you? Oh, I made the mistake. To pick Adam Sandler. Why is that a mistake? I dunno. You see normally during the day, but they were, they did it special for me at night. Oh, why? And he must have decided, well, we can go r it's our radio cuz it's at night or something. But he, he practically, he, I showed up. In his horrible clothing that she was, they big shorts and they, and, and then just went on to insult me and my family and roast me for half an hour. And the worst part is that I still love him. Well, yeah. It's hard not to love, isn't it? He was very funny. He was so funny. Well, when we come back, we're gonna see, I saw your movie last night and, um, look at the face. I can't even believe what I, I mean, honestly, I. I can't. Well, we're gonna see a little bit of that when we come back. Sma. Hi. Pino is with us Magic. You can it. Why won? Imagine Mike's last dance. I wish I could show the whole. Five minutes. And that's just the beginning. That is, I mean, it is. You are, um, he's like chant. He's chanting all over your Tatum is what he's doing. He's lifting you up. He's you're on his head. You're up against the wall. You're up against the glass. Mm-hmm. It really, I mean, there's, was that not, was, that had to be somewhat exciting. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Stop. What? Yeah, it was also challenging technical. It seemed like it was, it seemed a little bit dangerous actually. It was at some, you know, there's one part that's not in it where I'm upside down and my legs had to be somewhere, but upside down one looses sense of direction. Yeah. And I didn't do what I was supposed to do, so I, in the rec rehearsal, I went like, Head down, almost hit my head. I, he held on to my pants, but. I was really concerned because my pants, he was pulling my, my, my pants were going away and I couldn't remember if I had underwear or not. Oh, in this moment. Yeah. So instead of putting my hands to protect my head, I just held onto the pants and then, and he, he's like, but your hands out bitch. Cause he's like, but your hands out. I'm like, No, no. Hold onto my leg. I'm like, no, no, no. Until the, everybody came in and kind of took me away from him and he said, what's wrong with you? I said, what's wrong with me? Killed me. That was really something else. Had you, have you had a lap dance before from a, a male dancer? Uh, not really. No. Not really. No. No. Yeah. Channing really knows how to do it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you are gonna start somewhere, why not Channing? But you know what? I deserve it. I deserve that. He. Creeper in so many movies before and now I just got to sit down and enjoy. Yeah. I don't take my clothes off. I didn't have to be like them all day. You know, the only problem is that, uh, towards the end, I, I, I went to go in the water and then I saw a lot of people and I knew I had an exercise and I've been hitting the Cuban food and they're like, come on, we have to go. If you're gonna get in the water now. And then Chaning arrives from the back. Then he goes, what are you doing sitting there on the floor? Get in the, and I said, no, no, no. I don't want to take my thing, or I don't want anybody to see me on a, take a picture. And he goes, oh, don't worry. I've been walking up and down for hours hoping for someone to take a picture of me because every time I gain weight, I go to the to the water for one second and they take a picture. And today that I'm in my best. Shape after all the work I've been doing. Nobody's taking my picture. That was impressive. Is that seen the reason you've taken your husband's last name you've incorporated into yours? Because I, I, I don't know what I would think if that, if, uh, if I saw my wife, um, in that scenario I'm and fully clothed and yet it is, um, incredibly vigorous. Yes, but he gets the same, but even better than without the clothes. Yes. So I don't think he's gonna complain. Oh yeah, that's true. That's a good, that's, you know what, that's a good point. You, it's an excellent point. I've always had the name, but everybody refused to say it, so. Right. Uh, now you're put my, my publicist are loud saying Okay. Because they don't even put it sometimes in the movies and like, Why didn't you put her full name? Oh, we forgot. Sorry. It's been printed, so somebody's making an Yeah. Well, it's great to see you. I, I hope you come to the Oscars. It's always a delight to have you. Me too. You're always amazing in it. Salma Pinot, everybody. There's a pinot at the end of it. Don't forget it.

Her latest is called Alice Darling. It opens in AMC Theaters January 20th. Please welcome Anna Kendrick. Great to have you here. What an amazing audience. That's so nice. Oh, thank you for braving the bomb cyclone to be here tonight. I did it specifically for you and only you. Oh, I appreciate that. Did you ever work in a movie theater? Uh, because I bet you would be good at the thing cause you were good at the cup deal with the, you know. Oh no. Yeah, that's Skill not translated. I never worked in a movie theater. Um, my brother worked in a movie theater. Um Oh, okay. Yeah. So, so, uh, he works at a movie theater that actually. I ended up getting drunk for the very first time as a teenager at his, at the movie theater that he worked at. Cause it was like after hours and you could sneak in alcohol and I think it was, um, like coffee, brandy and milk, which is kind of a staple in Maine cause we're very classy. Is it really as a state. You drink your first time getting drunk was coffee, brandy, milk, coffee, brandy, and milk. I'm te No, it's weird to me that y'all think that is weird. Oh. Because in Maine that's like the state drink. We have an alcohol problem. It's not a, it's an, it's not a big deal. It sounds like something. It's very cute actually. Like the, the gorton's fisherman would have after a long day at sea. Well that's, that's like the kind of persona we're all going for in Maine Uhhuh. So, yeah. So I'm sitting there with like coffee brandy and milk watching like. The legend of bagger Vance or something and being like, this is so moving. I dunno. Did you, um, did you revisit the coffee brandy and milk later in the evening? Or how did that first experience go? Um, no, I, I, I think that once I moved to California, I never found it again and I, oh no, I meant did you vomit, but, um, yeah. Oh, I was trying to say it in a nice way and in a way No, no. I managed, uh, you managed, yeah. Well, that's very impressive. Was your older brother. Yeah. Yeah. So it was very like, oh, you know, like if you're gonna try alcohol for the first time, it should be while I'm around, it should be on my walks. Yeah. Yeah. Now, here's some milk. Very, very responsible. Yeah. Get some brandy and dairy products in you. It's funny because not only should you not be drinking brandy as a teenager, you shouldn't be drinking coffee probably either, right? Yeah. Or milk. Or like you're too old to be just drinking milk and Yeah. None of that was right. Yeah. You go home to your parents, you're like, yeah, but I did have some milk. Yeah. Yeah. For my bones. Was it a big secret? Like did you have to keep it quiet at home? Oh, yeah. No, I think like I, I walked in and, um, you know, your first time being drunk, you're like, I am pulling this off. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, you stand up and you realize you are, yeah. You would your brother give you like, stuff for free and sneaky? Uh, you said you snuck in, but, well, no, I mean, I think he probably did. I don't, I try to actually, I try to avoid movie snacks because I cannot stop myself from just like, Shoving the entire snack in my mouth before the movie has been done. I finish it before the previews are done? Yes. Before the preview have are even done. It's just like I can't stop myself. It's a conveyor. Me neither parts of just calories. I turn into a horse just eating out of a bag. Yeah, like a feedbag. Yeah. I need somebody to invent like a thing for nachos and popcorn. That's like one of those pet feeder things when you like leave your cat. That's a great for a weekend where it's like you have to wait until the next preview starts before you can take another handful of popcorn. That's a great idea. Maybe that's the only thing that's gonna slow me down. You know, maybe what they could do is cut a little hole in the bottom of the popcorn and then like suspend it a bug your head and so you could just take one at a time. Like a durable. Like a durable, exactly. That's brilliant. I think you could really market this because I have that same problem and I'm gonna tell you another thing. You don't have little kids. Right. I have a couple of kids who want to know what happened to all the popcorn. Oh. Because they get involved with their, you know, gummy rings or whatever they have. Right. And then they, then later it's like, dad, I just want some popcorn. I know. And then I act like one of the other, I was like, I don't know. I think, I don't know what happened. Yeah. I start looking around at my lap for us. Spares you have. But if we had little gerbil stations for them, if we only had gerbil stations, I tell you another thing, I'm sorry I'm talking too much about this. I once suggested to my wife that rather than come in the night to give our daughter a bottle, we set up a pet feeder in the, um, in the crib and we put formula in it. And then whenever she got gets thirsty, she could, you know, there's kind of nurse, like a little goat or something like that. So I'm, this is your solution for everything. I see. I guess so. Yeah. I got it. Yes. Moderation. He has one idea, but it's a solid idea. Oh, my mother is so obsessed with you. You would probably what? Call the police if you ever met her. No, no. My mother has watched Pitch Perfect hundreds of times. No, there. Yes. And I'm sorry you're reacting that way, but hundreds of times. That's so sweet. Yeah, the first 20 times it's sweet. The next 80 times it becomes crazy. And for a long time, anyone who walked in the house, I mean like the FedEx guy would show up, she'd be like, sit down. And then my uh, daughter's friend took video of her because she said, you have to watch this movie, sit down. And I want you to watch my mother watching you on. Oh my God, that's so amazing. I mean, she is the target demographic. That was so wonderful. That makes me so happy. Oh, good. Okay, good. Oh my God, I'm gonna be, make her less happy to see you. Why is she here? That's great. Oh my God. She, we have a restraining order against just a preemptive measure. Do you, um, did you make a New Year's resolution? Is that the sort of thing you do? Well, I make the same me's resolution every year. Um, I, I sort of, it's like a vague sense of like this year, Will be the year that I don't let like the kind of order and cleanliness of my house fall apart. Like I Are you messy? Like I'm, I'm so, I'm, I'm either hyper organized or hyper messy. So if I let like one crack in the system show, it's just all falls apart. And I'm always like, if I just perfect a, like this year I'm gonna come up with like, The perfect organizational system and, and I'm just like, last year's system was flawed. Okay. And it's like, no, the, the guy that runs the system is flawed, like the problem is me. Yeah. But do you have too much stuff? I have so much stuff. Well, I actually am like, uh, I moved, so right now I'm not even in the organization phase. I'm like in very small home repair. Phase Oh. Which gives me irrational anxiety. Really. Like I, I'll have somebody over to just like fix a light switch or something. And the second that there's like a, huh, this mm, this wire, I just am like, I will do, I go into overdrive, I will do anything to just be like, what is it? Just, it's fine. It's fine. Whatever it is, it's fine. Don't tell me. You can just leave it like if there's rats in the wall or like lizard people living in like an attic upstairs or something. Like just don't tell me it's fine. It's, you know what, let's burn this place to the ground. Like I don't, you know what? I don't even live here. We're trespassing. Let's get outta here. Like, I just like it for some reason it's like triggers this insane anxiety where I'm like, I will just do anything to have this conversation. Stop. So, well, we're gonna take a break. When we come back, we'll see a clip from the movie. Alice Darling. Anna Kendrick is here. We'll be right back. No, I lied to him. He doesn't even know that I'm. What I mean he does now. He called me. Well, why did you lie to him? Because I'm mad. What? You wouldn't love me if you knew how bad I am. Geez. Is that something that he tells you? That's Anna Kendrick and Alex Darley. That is not pitch perfect. You, your acting is really great in the movie, and, uh, it is, it's a very intense, I mean, I, I don't want to try to describe it with, is largely about a young woman in a very un unhappy, unhealthy. Uh, relationship. Yeah. It's about a woman in a psychologically abusive relationship and, and like, but it's, I don't know. It's not what you think it would be. It's like, I, I, I always feel like the filmmakers just did such an amazing job and it feels like when, like the first time you read, like one Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, where you're like, am I going crazy? Like just the experience of. Consuming that piece of media makes you like, am I crazy? What's going on? Um, did you feel that way while you were shooting the movie? Yeah. Well, we shot it in Canada and at that time the, the quarantine rules were really, really strict. So I was Oh, right. They were very strict. There was very strict. So like if you went into the country, you had to quarantine for two weeks and not like, Hey, stay away from people. It was like you stay in this room and the government comes and checks up on you to make sure that you haven't like left. The room like Justin Trudeau, uh, stops by and, uh mm-hmm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That's what happens. Yeah. Wasn't there a huge fine or something like that? Oh yeah. No, they would've like sent me away and shut down the movie and everything, so I had to stay in this. In this room for two weeks, which, um, which did make me feel like I was going crazy. That's crazy. I drank so much wine. Um, and I was just like, on this lake, which was very picturesque until it's like day 11 and you've had a lot of wine and then you're like, I'm going crazy, but I'm just method acting. Wait, so you were. Quarantined on the lake as a movie revolves around your, around a lake. Yeah. On that same lake where you shot the movie. Yeah. Yeah. So we were, um, like shooting around this lake and my, well, I was actually staying at this, this tiny little place that was on the lake as well, which there's a, I mean, in that clip I'm like, Uh, coming outta the water. So there was a, there, there are scenes that are kind of like underwater and it's a little indie movie, so we had like six hours where we could afford to rent like underwater cameras and have like a safety guy and scuba gear around. And, um, the director was like, yeah, there's just like this one shot. We really need you to be like under the water for a little bit longer. But like, they've sent away the, we can't afford to get like an underwater camera back. So I think it's like the last shot of the movie even is, uh, the, the cinematographer just went to Walmart and bought a fish tank and like put our one good camera in the fish tank and was like, I really hope this is a good fish tank. And um, and so in the place that I was staying, like after work in secret, we were not permitted to do this. Um, I like. And in that scene I'm like in my bra and like the director Mary is on the dock like saying action, but it's just this one guy with a camera in a fish tank and me and my bra, and there's like preteen boys like several houses down going like, is that lady from that one movie in a bra? Like doing a weird sex thing with a camera and a fish tank? And yeah, I was like, I'm really, I hope that these kids are jaded enough that they're just like, whatever, and not. Putting this on TikTok right now. Oh yeah. No. Yeah. They're no. Kids are never that jaded. They never get that jaded. It just doesn't happen. Wow. That's pretty crazy. Yeah. So you violated international law there in Canada. You were so careful about the Covid and then after Covid, but then I was like indecent exposure. Yeah. You fished tank indecent exposure. Very cool. I'm a professional woman. What do you want, and I know you are, speaking of being a professional woman, you just directed a movie. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I just, Uh, directed my first feature, which I wasn't expecting to do, and it came together really fast, and it was like the most fun that I've had in years. Years. This is a crazy story. I Oh, yeah. The, the true story. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's based on a thing that really happened in the 1970s. This woman went on the dating game and the man that she chose was a serial killer. Yeah. And, uh, wrong choice. Yeah. Bad choice. Um, yeah. Like crazy, crazy true story sort of from her perspective. And I just, I had so much fun doing it, but I, I will say that like, Uh, I f you know, directors, like, they're great. They're, they're great. Please hire me. But, um, uh, they think they're really interesting cuz they're so like, hyper-focused on the thing that they're making that they, I think they expect you to be as interested in that thing. But then I'm now like, The last like three months of my life, I've been hyper-focused on this thing. So I find myself going like, well, there was this one set that was like orange and purple, and then we decided that like we wanted to make it more rust than eggplant. And like why is every, why is everybody walking away? And why is everybody feel like they hate me? Like more than usual? Do you have someone in your life who pretends to think everything you say is interesting? Well, you have to. Well, yeah. I mean, yeah, but once the commercials hit, forget about it, then that's, it's over. No, but no, that's so fascinating about the orange, um, set. No, it's, it's like nobody wants to talk to. That's a great story. My stories are like, that's a crazy story. I look forward to seeing that. I know a little about, about that story. They think that guy may have killed like over a hundred people. Right? Yeah, no, it's really terrifying. It's like, Definitely a great kind of metaphor for like you think you know what you're getting yourself into and like who's the person behind the curtain and it's just like such a terrifying story. I wonder if like in like 25, 30 years we'll find out one of the bachelors killed a hundred people. That seems likely. Yeah. I mean, for sure. Well, it's great to have you here. What's the name of the, the movie, uh, that, that you directed? Oh, um, it's doesn't have a title right now. Oh well, okay. That's a terrible answer. Okay. You have to seem interested. You're doing a great job. Thank very much. I appreciate it. Well, I can't wait to see you Untitled and um, Alice Darling. Opens, uh, at the movies in a m c Theaters on January 20th.

Forget 20 years. They have more than 250 years in show business Combined, they have won every award and collected every accolade imaginable. Now they're out to win a Super Bowl two in the new Comedy 80 for Brady. It opens the theaters February 3rd. Please welcome. Lilly Tomlin, Jane Fonda, Rita. I mean, look at this. I don't think we've ever had a foursome as impressive as the four of you, so thank you for coming. It's great. This is, uh, did you, did your carpool here together? No, we should have though, with the way Jane thinks we should. That's right. Jane is very Yes, she's very, she cares about the environment. Yes, she, you really do. Jane, don't you? Hmm. Yeah. But we all do. You know, it's not just a one person. She's a great influencer. That's important that she, yes, that's for sure. Yeah. But I am, and I don't wanna argue right off the bat with you, Rita, Jane cares more than everyone else does. I agree. She really does. Who among you has known each other the longest? Which duo? Well, me and Fonda, right? Yeah. But I think then Fonda and I are second. You guys are second. You guys are first you met on, is it, what did you meet on nine to five? Is that where it happened? Well, I, I admired her from a distance and then, uh, I can, I wear glute hairdo and I try to show her. But she never noticed. And then one day she came to see me on stage. Okay. And then she offered me the Parton nine to five. Oh, wow. How about that? And while I was driving home from the theater after being smitten by this one, I turned the radio on and Dolly Parton was singing two doors down. And I suddenly got this image of Dolly Parton at a typewriter. You know, she can't see her hands, but wow. She's never done a movie. That would be really something to, is that true? Is that true? Is that really true? On the way home from seeing Lily, you thought about Dolly. Yeah, and they both had the same manager. Took me a year to convince them what, why was, who was the holdout? You were Dolly, both of them. Dolly held out too. Oh yeah. And then a week into the shooting. She wanted to quit. She's so neurotic. That's why she's, I dunno why you say that. What tipped you off that she was neurotic? The fact that she's wearing a clete haircut when she met you? No, the fact that she's working for, for, first of all, that she needed to be convinced. Uh, it took me a year to convince her to be in the movie. Then she was in it for a week and said, I, I need to go quit. I'm no good. I mean, oh, you were insecure? Yeah. Oh. Well, first of all, surpris Fonda was there, Uhhuh, you know, and, and Dolly. Dolly was there. It'd be a lot of reason to be insecure. Have you guys, have you and Rita worked together before? That's right. Rita was on Grace and Frankie on Grace and Frankie, you're right. And Sally and Jane. You guys knew each other from when? Well, Jane, uh, sent me a letter right after I did Norma Ray, so that was in 1980 and said, I, I really, you know, like your work, let's have lunch together. And I wrote her back and I think I still have the letter that she sent me, but I didn't have the letter I sent her that said, I admire you so much. But I can't have lunch with you because I would just be too nervous. And I said, no, I can't have lunch with you maybe someday. And then literally, and then a, a year or so later, I had a, I had a development deal at Fox and she had a deal at Fox. I didn't know what I was doing. I sat there in this office alone without a typewriter or a person. I sat there, why am I here? What am I doing? And knock on the door. And it was Jane and she had her development company, like across the hall, across the street. And she said, time's up. That's it. Time's up. We're going to lunch right now and forever after I couldn't get her outta my life. And is it true that, um, Jane and Rita, you guys somehow met through Marlon Brando? No. Oh, no, no, no. I met. We met when I was doing her part, violet Newstead in the TV series nine to five. Oh, and the TV was here. I was playing violin Houston. That's when he got, that's when I met Jane who was producing the uh, TV series. I see. I don't know why I thought there was some like story about what you were playing. Well, I was friends with Marlon Brando and he had, was in love with her and so I. Followed that. There's lots of stories to be told, but we can't get into it really. Are you, are you thinking of one in particular? Is that what's happening? Oh, I'm thinking of something else. Would you like to know? Yeah. Well, I'd love to know. Yeah. Okay. Don't go there. Don't go there. I'm telling you right now, she doesn't like just start singing Moon River and she'll strike it. When I talk about. She doesn't like it when I talk about sex, and I love to really, i, I, I just, I like it as much as anybody does. You know what? It's just I don't like being graphically verbal about it in public like this. I mean, come on. Well, I love it. Don't have to talk about. Too. You do? Yeah, I do too. Rita, please don't be, there's a reason I'm 91 now, you know? So, so I, I should, we wanna say, I hope you had nothing else planned to, I don't. I simply want to say, yeah, that my favorite scene in the movie takes place in the locker room. Where the guys are, you know, Gronk, all of these guys, you were in the locker room and I entered the room and it's a real locker room and I swear to God. In like in seconds I got turned on. You're saying a room full of naked men excited you? For some reason, not only excited me, I kept grabbing myself. Really? Oh, like a monkey, like a, I kept saying to myself, what is wrong with you? You weren't that. It was then 90. I'm 91 now. I said, you are 90, and I'm saying to myself, and then I thought, There's nothing wrong with that. No, not at all. Why? You'd be embarrassed by that. I wanna put a picture up on the wall. Um, if you don't mind. Uh, speaking of, um, climate change, the environment, everyone, everyone other than Rita, um, being arrested at various, uh, protests and. Yeah, boy. The three of you look so happy to be arrested. Jane is a bad influence, isn't she? She, Jane, you, did you make this happen? Did you encourage this? Yeah. Yeah. Do you, when you have friends that are um, arrested, do they ever get upset with you for talking? Every single one of them thanked me and really said they found it a transformative experience. Wow. Yes. At that point we needed to be arrested cause, cause we couldn't let Jane be arrested again. Otherwise they would take her away for a week. Is that what it is? No. Many months. Many months. We had a contract. It would've been gone for many months. Yeah. The three strikes law has applied to you, James. And so we all said we're threw ourselves on the sword. Well, we'll go, we'll go. And then, you know, they just detain it. No, but the crisis is so serious. Yeah. That we have to move from being concerned about it to taking action and putting our bodies on the line. Next time I have a live. Rally, I'll ask you all to come and join me. All right. We're gonna take a break. Um, we're gonna, uh, handcuff everyone and we'll be right back. Uh, with the cast of 80 for Brady. He's the most responsible one. Oh me. Okay. Oh, good thing I brought my scrap on. Oh, I don't think that's what it's called. Sure it is. Look, you just. Strap it on. Wow, that's a fanny pack. Well, not if you don't wear it around your fanny. If you wear it like this, it's a strap on, and I don't put them safe. We're back at the Pa Brady, Lilly Tomlin, James Bond, Rita Moreno, and Sally Field. Um, so this movie is based, uh, loosely but based on a real group of women who were New England Patriots fans. They started this group over 80 for Brady. Fans of Tom Brady and, uh, and you guys were inspired to depict them in the film. This is, do you watch football? Are you football fans? Oh yeah. Sound. He is. Yeah. I love it. I love it. Yeah. Lilly, no. Jane? No, I'm baseball. Baseball. I, I'm baseball too. And, and I'm basketball. Whoa. Just three sons. Oh, well that explains it. Yeah. Soccer. Not so much. Tom Brady is one of the producers of the film. Right. That's great. And is also in the movie with you. Yeah. Yeah. What was it like, um, acting with Tom Brady? Oh, it was great. He's very natural actor. Was he? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, listens very well. Perfect. Perfect. Everyone agree with that? He's Marv. He's marvelous in it. I was really kind of, that's great. I was very impressed and in fact touched and when she says listens, it's, you know, actors sometimes don't listen well, they're just listening to dialogue. This guy really listens and she had a long speech that she had to say to him and he was, he was marvelous in it. When, um, you met him, did you start touching yourself all over? Yep. Yep. He's up. He's a little old. Imagine, imagine you thought you're in a not very large motor home because you're sharing it with somebody else and, um, Tom Brady walks in. My knees gave way. Really? Well, I mean your knees always give way. Yeah. Not for the same reason though. Okay, good. Okay. Like he filled up the whole place. His aura was so huge that. Oh really? Don't say anything. Yeah, I shut up. It would be her, not me. I'd like to hear about Very Street and Generous gave us all a jersey that he signed. Okay, nice. And I was holding myself up, holding onto the stove. No, I I, when I knew they were coming, I went out and welcomed all the ball players and I stood out there and offered them coffee. I, they didn't come into my motor home cuz I said, hi, I'm Sally. Anybody want some coffee? This is why the other actors are, and I, I'm here and gosh, I'm so glad you're here. And that's why we appointed her the responsible one. That's why you got to Mama Sally the youngest. Of us all. That's right. You're like a kid's sister to this group here. Yeah, I am. Yeah. I heard Rita, that you are, you have a text relationship with Marshawn Lynch now, is that true? Oh yeah. He, uh, not only Marshawn, but uh, with the, uh, Ludicrous. Really? We're, uh, we're text buddies. You Marshawn and ludicrous. Are you on a chain together, Chris? I met, I'm, you know, I'm in the next Din Beel movie. Oh wow. I think I said Din Beel. Yeah.

He fell in love with me and just his friends Uhhuh and we were like text buddies. Wow. And Marshon too. I suddenly get, but Marshon never signs his stuff, so I'm always. Writing back, who the hell are you and why don't you, why don't you put your name on your messages? Who are you? How does it happen, Marshan, that you exchanged numbers with Marshon in the first place? I had no idea who he was. I didn't know who he was. And we, there was a lot of time between takes and we just started to talk and gab and I thought he was so sweet and you know, we got to the point where I would hug him and say, hello, how are you every day? And uh, I think he said, can I have your number? I said, absolutely. Wow. And they have it. And a nutshell, your husband. Yeah, that's quite, that's, I mean, that's gotta be the, like, that's what they do the, the couple of the year for sure. Yeah. Reno Moreno and Marshon Lynch. That's, he is in doll. He really is a sweet, shy man. There's a big dancing in the movie. Was that something that was, uh, fun? Touche. Shoot. Yeah. Well, Jane says, no. Some, some of us had fun. Oh, I, I learned just today that I, I mean, I was dancing next to Rita. I was beside myself with glee. I was dancing next to she, she said today she admitted she was dancing down. We're dancing down. Wait a minute, you know, I'm dancer, right? So my duty as an actress was to not dance. As well as anybody. Oh, come on. You trying the best. I saw the sweat on your brow.

Mr. Kle, please explain. Did Harry spit on me? Um, hey there everybody, this is Chris Pine for Esquire. Uh, they've asked me to answer some questions about my career, so I think we should dive in, right? Let's do it. How did it feel to go super viral as a Twitter meme? What were you really thinking in that moment? Put me on an important zoom call, watching my cat throw up on the scene. It's too good. My therapist, while I read aloud an entire text in between me and a guy. It's a long flight. The Italy. It's a long time. I'm so jet lagged. And then you get thrown into a press conference where you have to talk about a film you made five and a half years ago. I was just tired. Frankly. Your hair has been on quite a journey this year. What was the thing in mind? You finally cut it off. I thought I was looking pretty, pretty fla. The hair was long and everything was happening and my publicist said that I looked like Rachel from friends. I couldn't un unhear it, and it was the first day of my first time in Venice. Also, it should be known that the press conferences in Venice are in the, one of the most gorgeous buildings I've ever seen, and the ceilings are like blue with gold guilt. So there's one of these where I'm looking up and really what I'm thinking is like, how can I do that to my ceiling? That's what was going through my head. Simple, yes or no? Mr. Ply, please explain. Did Harry spit on me? Did Harry spit on Chris? Some people think this viral clip shows Harry spitting on Chris Link and you'll miss it. The moment had been reviewed from different angles. Harry did not spit up. Me. Harry's a very, very kind guy. I was trying to figure out, I was on the plane with my publicist who says, I look like Rachel from France. We're flying back from Venice, and I'm sleeping. I have a great time on the plane. I love planes. And I, she wakes me up in a, in a, you know, in a, in a state. And she said, we have to craft a, we have to craft a message about what happened in Venice. And I was like, about what about you? About Harry spitting on. Which I had no, we had, I had no idea what happened. Show me the thing. And it does look indeed like Harry's spitting on me. He didn't spit on me. I think what he said is he leaned down and I think he said it's just words, isn't it? Because we had this little joke. Cause we're all jet lagged. We're all trying to answer these questions and sometimes when you're doing these press things, your brain goes and befuddled and you know, you start speaking gibberish. And we had a joke. It's just word man. Is it just us or does Chris Pine look ridiculously good this year? It is not just you. Boy, oh boy. Your style evolution has not gone to notice. How would you describe your personal style? Awesome. Ridiculously cool. Oh my God, I, someone said that it was either from the BGS or I was, uh, Greg Alman. Can you speak clinging on? Can you do livelong prosper? Well, obviously I'm interesting story too, I should show this picture. Is that Michael Dorn? This is a picture of Michael Dorn, but he was on a television show with my father Robert Pine chips. Did Williams shatter gimme any advice about, uh, playing Captain Kirk? He did not. I met him in an equestrian event. He's very nice, very kind. That was my only run in with him. I saw him recently actually at, uh, the famous Mr. Chow in Los Angeles, which looks like Tokyo Black Rain from 1988 or something. Seems like everybody should be doing drugs there, but Bill was not doing drugs. He was eating a lot of Kco chicken. Your father was in some of the biggest hit shows of your childhood. What industry advice did he pass on to? You don't do it. There you go. Yeah. I don't think my parents were super interested in me pursuing a path that, you know, was difficult to say the least. But also that being said, in credit to my parents, I grew up in a, first of all, I grew up in Hollywood, meaning I grew up in artistic family. And once they realized that I was really interested in it, they, you know, They, they definitely supported it. Are you a crier? Do you cry at movie? Sad commercials. I mean, I have the ability to cry. Yeah, I can cry. Do I cry at movies? I do. I can cry at sad commercials though. I can't really tell you the last time I saw a commercial. It's not wild. You worked with Taylor Sheridan on Heller High Water thoughts and joining him in the Yellowstone Universe at some point. I love Montana. I love Kevin Costner, ally Horses. I really do. I like horses. Gabby Mendez at, Hey, Gabby Mendez. If Mr. Chris Pine isn't on Princess Diaries, three, I'll be throwing hands. Don't know what throwing hands means. Thanks, Gabby. You're not getting 10% though, fortunately. Uh, that's a actor joke. Bottle shock. Did you learn much about wine in this role? If I did, I forgot. It's a wine joke. Chris Pine has realized that ballet's an incredible workout. Ballet is incredible. I think everyone should do ballet. It's very masculine, but it's also very feminine. There's, you have to meet. You have to combine. The two young boys should do ballet. Trust me, you'll thank me later. What's your go-to shower song? Karaoke. It's pretty much always Sinatra. Pretty much always. Sinatra. Sinatra or Marvin Gaye. Do you play Dungeons and Dragons? Do you know about the Hollywood d and d meetups? No, I, I've heard about Ello and I've heard about Vin Diesel, who's apparently a big player. A lot of people play, uh, and I think it's really cool, a great idea for a drinking game as an adult. I mean, it's like, you know, act like an idiot and have fun. What do you love the most about Dungeon Dragons? Uh, what I love most about Dungeon Dragons is it's so creative. It's just imagination based. It's kind of, it is like being an actor and, you know, you just play pretend, and it's like improv. So I, I think it's really fun and I think it's a great way to bond. You know, I like my, my nephew plays it, uh, religiously and has for years and, um, it's a great way to make friends and I just think, uh, All children should play it. Favorite thing about directing your first feature, Pullman? My favorite thing about directing the film was everything. I loved every moment of it. It was an absolute delight to do. I mean, I got to work with Annette Benning and Danny DeVito and uh, Jennifer, Jason Lee, and. It was like 24 7 flow state.

This is my career time. Those golden grams taste like honey grams. It's a delicious honey Graham taste. So things started out in commercials as a lot of careers do. I love doing it cuz I got to skip school and oftentimes I got to do sort of fun stuff. Go-kart riding or bike riding and then eat a lot of sugary cereal and get all hopped up. That was fun for me as a kid. I remember I had to kind of go down a, a hill and kind of a soapbox derby for one of these commercials or show that I could, uh, follow, uh, tape X on a stick. I remember for this Honeynut Cheerios commercial, my skillset was pretty high, pretty early, if you could tell. Little House and Prairie was sort of my first big, uh, type of thing. I was on that show for a year, got adopted into that family. I just remember them being a really nice group of people and Michael Landon was directing and, and acting and writing, uh, the shows. And that was a, a great first experience to have as a, as a little kid seeing that it, it's not a, it's not a scary place. The, the set come up us, Mr. Engles. Ms. Summers Chicago may be the windy city. But when you arrive, it will be breathless after Little House and Prairie went on to silver spoons and a few other, uh, sitcoms for years after that. Again, skipping school was a big part of the draw. I wasn't too focused on money at the time. Didn't have to spend on a lot of things, you know, I, as a kid, Somehow those clothes and food just magically appears in the house. So it was all about skipping school and in this case, playing in front of a live audience. It was a lot of fun to play, at least in silver spoons for this devilish character named Derek. I'm sorry, it just says . Darn puberty. Sunday, a night rider, a shocking accident. Destroys kit's. Memory. Stay away from me. Can guest star Jason Bateman helped Michael save him? There was an episode of Night Rider, remember where I, I was 15 so I wasn't, I couldn't get legally Drive, but I got to drive the kit car, the, the Night Rider car. I remember that was. Even more excited than skipping school. I got to drive this trans Am and of course David Hasselhoff being there was pretty sweet too. Skip school, drive a car, chum it up with the Hoff. What's this? And I know we've all given up a lot. Brian here lost a girlfriend and well, Gregory had to give up the track team and well me, I've lost a lot of sleep between. Dating Brian's old girlfriend in track team practices after, uh, silver spoons. There was a show called, it's Your Move where I've got to play, uh, eaten even more devilish character of sort of a conniving conman. Uh, but in school and when junior high, we made pocket money selling, uh, Paul passes, doctor's notes, and even the pit bull cream we made out of Crisco and sand. That was a lot of fun. That only lasted about a year because, uh, n NBC was getting notes from parents across the country that their kids were starting to do the same things that they were writing my character to do. Little schemes on how to, uh, teach kids how to cheat in school and, uh, steal your neighbor's stuff and how to make a copy of a key that says Do not copy. So, um, they had to shut it down. Now we need that $500 to pay the ban. All my money's tied up in municipal bonds. Hand after it's Your move was a show called the, well, it started out being called Valerie, and then it was called Valerie's Family, and then they switched it to the Hogans and then the Hogan family. So in five and a half years there were four titles. It was one of my favorite jobs. Of my career, my life, and I love all those people. That was, uh, a really felt like a really safe, uh, cave we were in. Like we all had a job and it was gonna last forever. And, and then you realize things go away on the, the Hogan family, that was my first chance to direct. It's a multi-camera show where there's a studio audience, you shoot it like a play. And it was, uh, a lot of fun and very challenging to work out sort of the puzzle of making sure each camera is pointed at. The next actor who's about to speak was a lot of fun to sort of not drop the ball for all these adults that were working there and giving this kid this responsibility. So that was important that I had this positive initial experience with directing and, and, and has led to my passions. That's such a crappy word, but, uh, that's why I love directing today cause I didn't have a bad experience then. Woo. Jason Bateman is King Wolf two. He's going through a few changes. I don't howl. W you don't see any things, do you? I did my first film when I was 18. I think I was, uh, it was Teen Wolf, two winner of three separate Academy Awards. Best picture, best actor. And I think we got director too. Although I might be confused, but definitely actor and picture. That was a great decision, obviously. And uh, boy, we just had fun on that. Um, it didn't feel like we were doing something AC Academy Award-winning, but boy were we wrong. Check it out. You'll uh, you'll see what we mean. Toby, Kellogg's been away from his family while I was gone. They moved back in those days, there was a movie every week that the networks would make called. The movie of week, there's one called Moving Target that I remember. I had a lot of action running around. I remember jumping off a bridge as bridge in Century City. So still to this day, every time I drive under it, I remember shooting that day. That was kind of cool. I did another one where I played my sister's brother, family Ties, Justine Bateman and Jason Bateman and unforgettable performance. I have been outside looking into the real world for so made you feel me, dancing Monday. She played a blind. Woman in that, what do I have to do to get some attention around here? Go blind. She was great at that, except for one day she put her hand through a plate glass window and cut a nerve. I think she still does not have feeling in her, one of her pen keys to this day. Watch it. Don't take the blind rolls. Where's my family? Jason Bateman is a moving target. Monday after oath. I want you to meet my brother Simons. Alright, firework. Maybe he's on to something. There was a sitcom called Simon that was right at the beginning of the WB when that was first coming out and we were so low rated that we were. Think we were a hundred ninth out of 111 shows maybe that were on TV at the time. We, we had hats made for Everybody's a Christmas gift that just said 1 0 9 on it. Chicago's Sons was a show that I did where, uh, I, I played one of three brothers that live in Chicago and I remember Scotty Pippen, um, the Chicago Bull and Gabby Reese were, they were both guest stars on that. I thought that was awesome. I'm a big sports fan. David Krumholtz and DW Moffitt. Uh, we were all brothers and loved those guys. We had a, we had a really good time. Uh, Ted, uh, why, why don't, uh, you and I go, go in the kitchen and, uh, and, uh, and what, and, and, and be, be in the kick. George and Leo was another show that I did. I played the son of Bob Newhart, which was. An incredible honor and thrill. I remember being able to see Bob Newhart do a five minute set of standup comedy just for that studio audience every, every Friday when we would shoot the show. That was pretty cool. What'd he say? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slowed down. Uh, when it comes to letting people in my apartment, I have very strict requirements. I got first and last month's went and you've met them all. Burn refreshments. Some of my best friends was a show that was, uh, sitcom on cbs, which was about, um, a gay man living with a straight man as roommates and the hysterics that would come from something like that. Nowadays diversity is, is is much, much better represented on television and I don't think people would think that that was such a, a mind blowing concept, but at the time, I guess it was. And we definitely had some fun. Wasn't, wasn't a long lasting show though, for one reason or another. Uh, what about wrestling? I really like to watch wrestling. Said, why? Tell me the truth. Okay. Cause there's been a lot of lying in this family and a lot of love. More lies. Arrested Development was a show that was clearly a huge, huge help to me and my career, and that was a, a big life preserver for me. That was an audition that came my way. An ex, uh, agent, an old agent of mine, called and said, Hey, I, I'm looking at the breakdown on this. Casting for this show, and I see that you haven't read for this, this show, you should ask your new agents. So I asked my new agents to send me in on that, and they say, yeah, you're not gonna wanna read for that. That show's never gonna get on the air. It's uh, it's sort of, it's like a documentary and, uh, and there's a narrate, or Ron Howard's gonna do the narrating and I, I don't even know if they're ever gonna be able to get him. And apparently there's no dressing rooms, there's no lights, there's no makeup. It's a mess. I said, well, can I read it? They said, sure, you can read it if you want. So I read the script and of course it was incredibly funny to read and uh, I went in and read for it and ended up just sort of guessing right, to what they might want out of that role of Michael Bluth. The guy, the boss, Mitch Hurowitz, followed me out of the room and said, Hey, uh, you're auditioning tomorrow for this other show that I'm producing. But this, this one, right? You like this? I said, yeah, love to do this show. He said, great. He said, don't come in for that show tomorrow cuz I don't want that network to see you. I want you to do this one. And I was like, did this guy just gimme the job? So that was, that was a very exciting day for me and my career. And, and of course the show turned out to be, uh, one of my favorite things ever. And I owe a lot to, uh, to Mitch her with. Now do you wanna steer or are you too old to sit on your pop's lap and drive? I think I might be okay. Hi, mark Lauren, I'm the husband, and this of course is Juno, like the city in Alaska. No. Juno was a film that was, uh, really helpful to my, uh, film career because, uh, a lot of people loved that movie. And, um, it, it kind of took off a bit. And, uh, I was nominated for Best Picture, I believe, and Jason Wrightman was a very nice man to put me in that film. And it was a, a really fun, positive, high quality experience. I work mostly from home. I'm a composer like Johan, Brahms, or, uh, more commercial stuff. Like what? Commercials if I don't get home before age, he puts on the sweatpants, and once the sweatpants are on, I get nothing. Hi Extract was a film that I did, a Mike Judge film that I just thought was just a really, really funny script, really funny movie. Mike Judge is one of the nicest people you could ever hope to work with, and Kristen Wig was in it. Me, LA Kuni, Ben Affleck. I highly recommend it. That one sort of, uh, was under the radar a bit. I get paranoid when I smoke pot, but if you smoke a little, I've even done a music video for Mumford and Sons. Jason Sadiki called me or emailed me or something he said. Said, Hey, uh, me and Ed Helms and Will Forte are gonna get together and, and play, uh, the band, Mumford and Sons. I, that's all I kind of really needed to hear, and it just sounded ridiculous. And we got to play you, you know, little banjos and be real jack asses and that that was. Put together beautifully. Well, the spelling bee is meant for kids. Rule number 24, the speller must not have passed beyond the eighth grade on or before February 1st. You can see there I have not passed the eighth grade. Not ever. I've always wanted to direct a movie. I wanted to be a father, a husband, and direct a movie that those are the three things I wanted to do before I. Got hit by a bus. The film was bad words. I'm really happy with it, proud of it. Few people have seen it. They seem to like it. Although the people that didn't like it, they're not stopping me on the street and telling me I suck and that that was garbage. So I'm in a little bit of a bubble. A lot of people might hate that movie. I just don't know about it. But I am hearing from those that did, there's at least a dozen. Maybe a baker's. Hey moms, let's break out the rubber pillowcases tonight. Little pricks are gonna be counting tears, not sheep. Who's next? And if I wanna put all $7,945,400 into a hot tub, get buck naked and play Scrooge McDuff. That is a hundred percent my business. Now, where's my money? The directing and the acting, uh, got progressively more comfortable for me going into Ozark, which to me was, uh, I was excited about the, uh, the challenge of directing, uh, like a 600 page movie. You know, I, I wanted to give it a try and for better or worse, with. I couldn't work out enough time to, to prep all the episodes and ended up just directing, uh, four of the 10, the first two and the last two. But that's just something I'm really, really proud of because there's just so many people that I managed to find, talk into coming to work on that show cast and crew and, and, and Netflix giving us such a, such a nice, generous push and support with it all and, and, and letting us create kind of this. Tone and, and atmosphere and moodiness and dangerousness and chilling elements that, uh, you know, are all there in the script. And then trying to figure out what that looks like and what it sounds like was, was my job as, as director and ep, where you make all these choices to kind of build this environment. And it's been, it's been really, really rewarding. Feel very, very fortunate, sir. There's no business opportunities that require that much cash. Not legal ones. Well, I agree to disagree. Staying employed is tough. Success or relevance is paper thin, and you've got to try to align yourself with as many talented and kind people as you can because you need them. It's, this is not an individual game. It takes, takes a team. And so working with quality people on quality things is, is what? I think fuels longevity and, and if, if you want to want to stay in it for a while, look for the good people.",Intonation,Enunciation,hello im jason bateman this is my career time those golden grams

acting uh got progressively more comfortable for me going into ozark which to me was uh i was excited about the uh the challenge of directing uh like a 600 page movie you know i i wanted to give it a try and for better or worse with i couldnt work out enough time to to prep all the episodes and ended up just directing uh four of the 10 the first two and the last two but thats just something im really really proud of because theres just so many people that i managed to find talk into coming to work on that show cast and crew and and and netflix giving us such a such a nice generous push and support with it all and and and letting us create kind of this tone and and atmosphere and moodiness and dangerousness and chilling elements that uh you know are all there in the script and then trying to figure out what that looks like and what it sounds like was was my job as as director and ep where you make all these choices to kind of build this environment and its been its been really really rewarding feel very very fortunate sir theres no business opportunities that require that much cash not legal ones well i agree to disagree staying employed is tough success or relevance is paper thin and youve got to try to align yourself with as many talented and kind people as you can because you need them its this is not an individual game it takes takes a team and so working with quality people on quality things is is what i think fuels longevity and and if if you want to want to stay in it for a while look for the good people,and,1.9862766341639582,0.9999

It was something that, uh, I was just taking it step by step, one foot in front of the other from small success to small success. You know, you look up and you have a decision to make, go to college and move to la, you know, and kind of pursue this dream. Hi, my name is Michael B. Jordan, and this is the timeline of my career. So, my first IMDB credit was, uh, the Sopranos in 1999. I was about 12 years old, and I was just a, you know, a. One of the extras, one of the background, uh, kids I think guy might have snuck in a couple lines. Uh, it was definitely an under five, uh, player at that time. And I was a bully. I was bullying Tony, uh, during one of his, uh, therapy sessions. Uh, and it was a flashback. He was just like kind of talking about his childhood and I guess how he used to get bullied on the boardwalk. And I was one of those bullies. And at that point, I think. The most exciting thing about being on set, the fact that I was not in school. I think it was one of the, the first times that I got a chance to skip school, to go to the city and work. At that time, the Sopranos, I mean, we didn't know that it was gonna be, you know, as epic of a show as it is today. The wire for me was, was a very pivotal moment in my career. First time I auditioned for, uh, Alexa, Fogel went in for Boaty. At first, I read for him. And I was too young, so they brought me back the next day for, for Wallace, and I ended up booking the role again. Another one of those shows and I guess characters that in its first season we never knew what it was gonna actually be. We were actually supposed to be canceled after season one, and they got renewed. I take pride in Wallace because, you know, I. You know, being an OG of the show, you know, one of the original cast members, uh, even though I got killed off towards the end of the season, it seemed to be a, you know, a death on, on television that, that resonates with a lot of people. Even today, I still get to wear where's Wallace shout outs? You know, as I'm walking, you know, uh, walking through the street. I think a lot of the right people watched that show at that point in my career. You know, a lot of casting directors, a lot of producers, a lot of people in powerful places that. You know, I guess became fans, you know, at a young age. So when I did audition for the next show, or got a chance to, you know, take general meetings and stuff like that, it was always a lot of love. So that went a long way. One of the things on the Wire is that nobody was safe. Everybody can go. I guess the, the best reference for that is like, game of Thrones nowadays, like, you know, every, everybody gets a, gets a shot to get killed. Usually just get the script. You know, you read through it, you just flip through it the first time. You just to make sure your name, you know, is, is at the, at the end of the episode, and then you go back and actually read it. Uh, and for me, I had that moment where, uh, Dave and Simon, you know, he comes, knocks on your trailer door and, and you, you, you never want that knock on, knock on your trailer. And so he, he knocked on my door and basically said, look, Mike, we love you. Everybody loves you, but that's exactly why we have to kill you. And, uh, Wallace has to go. And it was a, it was a sad moment for me at that point. It was just like, you know, me leaving my family just looked at everybody as my big brothers and like, And sisters and, and, uh, I was like, man, this all this has to stop. I can't, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna work anymore. But he was like, yeah, you'll be fine. Everybody, you know, you'll be, you'll be great. And then the, the death scene, the death scene was, uh, was very emotional. And I remember mom being on set. She was in video village and. And you could just hear her sobbing and crying and stuff like that. It was, uh, it was pretty distracting. I was like, ma, just to please ma, somebody, somebody please just take her off set. Please take her off set. But, uh, it was, it was, it was a good time looking back at it. Uh, Friday night lights. Friday night lights. So crazy. Peterburg texted me this morning randomly. I had an audition, went in there. One of the things about Friday, LA and, and Pete Burg in his system, he loves improv, he love improv and ad-libbing. And, uh, I was in the audition room and it was a scene where Vince Howard is supposed to be giving his, uh, his huddle, his like halftime huddle speech to his team and getting everybody like fired up and stuff like that. And I'm improving and I'm, I'm talking, I'm doing my thing, or whatever the case may be. And Peter Burke's just like throwing, like, throwing things at me saying things and just like yelling at me, trying to get me, trying to get me motivated. And to the point where I just like instinctually just ran at 'em and just tackled him right there in the middle of the room. And I was like, all right, I either got the job or I'm getting kicked outta here. So it, you know, we all know how that went. It's gonna matter. One, it doesn't matter how many games we win, how many touchdowns do I have to throw? All they see is a bunch of th coach, everybody thinks, but they never say it. When Vince Howard's one of those characters. That leaves people talking, you know, what could have happened? Where did he go to school? Did he go to pro? Did he not? Did he become a coach? You know, like what was his future? I think you know, Vince, you know, at the world, at his fingertips, I think he really cared about his family. He obviously loved sports, very athletic, you know, found a father figure and coach Taylor made peace with his own dad. I've decided to go to, I mean, who knows? I, I would like to think he went to, you know, he went to college. Uh, me personally, I'm a Michigan State fan, so Michigan State. Went to Michigan State, went to the League Hall of Famer, maybe Hall of Famer. Fruitville station for me was, I guess the first time that I ever had an opportunity to carry a film. I think inside, I, you know, as an actor at that age was pretty insecure and, you know, not really confident and what the future was gonna be. This was like my, my opportunity to really like show what I can do as a black man. At the time, there was a lot of police shootings really coming to the forefront and felt very frustrated and angry and didn't really have an outlet shit to say how I feel and express myself. And, uh, just so happened, perfect timing. Ryan Coogler was, uh, developing the script around, uh, the shooting of Oscar Grant in his, his hometown, and it was the perfect connection. Yeah, I needed him at that time and he needed me, whether we knew it or not. I read that script. It was very emotional. Uh, I got a chance to meet him. Found a kinship in him. You know, our brotherhood, you know, we, we, we connected, we set out to tell that story and we became very, very close. And, you know, the way that movie impacted, you know, my career, his career, uh, the lives of, you know, the grant family, everybody in Oakland across the country, and, you know, hopefully I would like to think around the world. Got a chance to, uh, experience a little bit of what Oscar grant was like. Should stop this. I'm stopping this one now. Don't. Okay. Let me finish. I gotta prove it. Prove what? I'm not a mistake. For me, creed of something that me and Ryan talked about before we shot one frame of Fruitville Station. It was something that was in his head a long time ago. Remember him just asking me like, Hey man, I'm doing this movie about, you know, Apollo creed's son, do you want to, you know, do you wanna play him? And I was like, yeah, cool. Let's do it. You know, we haven't shot one frame, one scene of the movie, but you know, that's the type of relationship me and Ryan had. And, uh, During that production, Ryan was running back and forth to, you know, MGM Sly, you know, just trying to, you know, make it happen. Trying to, you know, convince, convince sly to kind of come back in a row that he wasn't really planning on doing. And yeah, that process was, uh, was another milestone moment for me. Uh, first time I was able to really train, change my body, uh, like that training, taking on an iconic role, you know, like, uh, you know, playing Apollo creed's sun was, was really important as well. I wanna say this was the first time I worked with Actor from The Wire. Since, since I left the show, boys coming here, this is how they survive. They gotta fight for life killer bee kill people dying there. Your daddy died in the ring. And uh, you know, working in another iconic franchise was a good time. It was fun, joe. Of course, why would I be expecting anything? I have a lot of great relationships and sometimes things just come randomly from different places. Wanna say, Ava hit me up on this one. I might be wrong, but I think she hit me up and was just basically saying that she was erecting this, this video for them. And I was like, sure, let's do it. I mean, I'm, I'm one of those guys and I get a phone call from somebody within the, you know, the film community that, that I'm cool at and trust. It's like we're always down to collaborate on and be creative on certain things and I, I heard her vision and a story that she wanted to tell and I definitely wanted to be a part of it fit. And, uh, it was incredible, you know, that, that album, but they represent what they were trying to say during that album, I think was very influential and I was just pretty happy to be a part of it. I want to do, I want the throne. Eric Killmonger for me was first time playing a villain. Brian just called me up and was like, Hey man, I'm doing this thing. I think it'll be a good look, you know, for you to, you know, kind of step out of, uh, your comfort zone and do something different and then play a role that people haven't had, had a chance to see you play. And, you know, so we started talking about, you know, design, character design, you know, looks, you want to create an iconic hairstyle, something that would be in style, you know, in two years or something that we would kind of influence kids and, you know, people didn't want to kind of imitate. And it was a, a heavy role. It was a role that I didn't know how deep I was going to get into it until like, I think it was over. You know, you just kind of try to make decisions that feels right in the moment. You know, I didn't really have a, a set plan. It was just like day by day, really just like living in the moment and doing what feels right. Pretty isolated. I kind of stayed away from like, you know, people that I cared about and family for a long time, cuz that was, I guess, one of the main things with Eric. He was like a really lonely person. So I tried to embody that as much as I could afterwards, it kind of stuck with me for a minute, you know, there's no blueprint, there's no, there's no, um, you know, guidelines to like, you know, you know, getting into character and getting out or, and what that looks like, what that feels like. So just try to, you know, find my way through, you know, lean on people that's, you know, done it before in the past and just try to learn and grow from it. Tell me everything that happened the first time I visited death Row. I wasn't expecting to meet somebody the same age as me from a neighborhood just like ours could have been me. My, this movie is extremely important. You know, Brian Stevenson is not a perfect person, but I said his life, but he's, he's damn close. Uh, the guy is dedicated his life to a cause where a few people can say that they, they have. You know, such an important issue, such an important topic, you know, for this nation. And now he's, he's taking it head on, tried to be around him as much as possible. Tried to learn, you know, from him, tried to get the essence of, of who he is. But at first I didn't even know who he was and I was really embarrassed at that. Uh, so after I listened to his Ted talking, really got a full scope of his work and, and, and what he stood for. It was intimidating, but at the same time, I felt responsible to kind of take this story and, and, and share it with the world and try to get as many people as possible to see this film. If you hear his words, if you, if you know his story and that doesn't move you, that doesn't, you know, make you think or want to ask the right questions, want to ask questions, period, I think that's a problem. You know, he, he, uh, he's so, such, such a powerful speaker and his presence is, is truly, uh, is truly incredible. She tried to embody that, you know, working with Dustin and Jamie and Brie and, you know, all the producers, Gill and Asher, you know, we all collectively, you know, over the past couple years just trying to craft this story. You know, just Mercy is such a dense book with so much in and there. We wanted to just pick through few of the most memorable cases and moments throughout that book and, and make a movie that, you know, was well-rounded that made people think that was an honest portrayal of his journey. And hopefully we did that. I, you know, I look back 20 years, crazy to say, 20 years of anything you bet on yourself, I bet on myself and just continue just to, to, to work, you know, and, and try to grow and learn from each experience. And then, yeah, 20 years later, you know, production company, you know, I got, you know, great team around me. Projects that I'm extremely proud of, focused and just can't wait to continue to grow and do projects that you guys are hopefully, uh, you know, proud of too.",Eloquent,Pitch Range,i guess in the beginning it wasnt planned it was something that uh i was just taking it step by step one foot in front of the other from small success to small success you know you look up and you have a decision to

I'm distracted by my cleavage. Can I say that? Is that weird? Hi, I'm Anna Kendrick and I'm about to watch some scenes for my career. Let's torture ourselves. How do you know Scott? He's a friend. It's hard for me to keep track sometimes cuz. He has so many friends. I forgot how passive aggressive and awful Stacy is. It's awesome. Brian Lee O'Malley who did the graphic novel, it's based on his real sister Stacy. I love that. She's just a, just a little shit stir. What an angel. I'll be honest when I read this. Script. I was like, I don't totally get this, but I love Shawn of the Dead. I love Hot Fuzz and I just wanted to work with Edgar Wright, but I do remember like this on paper being like, I don't know how this is gonna work, but I'm just gonna trust that uh, he sees it, which he did. It's so awesome. This is the first fight in the movie. The first kinda like sequence that goes crazy and then the bad Guy, Satia starts. Singing like a, a song. And I remember sort of being the only one to be like, I think that this might be a tough buy for the audience. Nobody like asked me to. But I remember when we were doing my single, just doing a bunch of reactions of like, what's going on? Like, someone explained this to me. I wasn't sure if Edgar was gonna be like, what are you talking about? And then he, uh, used a couple of those reaction shots and that made me feel. Happy. It was nice meeting you. Tell your gay friends I said Bye gay friends. Wallace again. The crash zoom thing. At the end of this, once Kiran has fully stolen my boyfriend, by the end of the scene we had to do that crash zoom. So many times because Edgar's so hyper specific, he doesn't even let you blink. He doesn't let you blink. There would be specific times where he was like, oh, like, uh, a purposefully timed blink here would be okay. This was very generous of him. He wanted me to turn, react. Then the crash zoom happens. Then I say the line or something. Something like that. Bill, Pope, uh, the cinematographer ended up taking over, just even operating the camera and the crash zoom and I could see like every time we would kind of overcompensate for the other, where we had like missed the moment perfectly and it just took forever. To this day with Edgar, I'm like, I do my own crash zooms. So the joke is that like, if you need to do a crash, zoom on me. I'll just like get myself really close to the camera. Ah, people don't like that. The director, Jason Moore and I, everywhere we filmed, if we. Saw a cup, we would just steal it. We had this like weird collection to like try out, once we got to this stage, we don't know what the surface of the stage is really gonna sound like. Then we had to justify that the cup was there. So, uh, yeah, someone came up with the, the pencils and pens thing. I did think it was funny to just like dump it out in front of them. It feels very much like when a, when a cat like is testing you and is like, what if I knocked this over? What would you do? Y'all gonna miss me when I'm gonna, oh, y'all gonna miss me here? You're gonna miss me everywhere. Oh, I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone. I had to sing something to prove that I could do it, and I was like, oh, well, I. I know this thing, but cuz I'm a dork and I learned to do this thing with a cup and there's this song and they were like, oh, let's put that in the movie. The audition song was supposed to be, I'm a little Teacup, which to this day I've never asked the, the writer Kay Cannon, like how was that supposed to play? Like, was it supposed to just be like a really good rendition of, I'm a Little Teacup? Cuz I don't think I would've been able to pull that off. I had no idea that this moment would become what it became when Universal was like, we should make a whole music video for this. I was like, what? Who would want that egg on my face? Now when I watch it, I can see I'm like rushing the back half of the phrase, each time I'm being nitpicky. But it wasn't until I had to record the song like, So that Universal could release it as a single, which again, at the time I was like, who's gonna want that? The music supervisor was like, I'm gonna put a metronome in there so that you stop rushing it. Cause I think I, you do get nervous and you're trying to just like do it, do it really quickly. It's like a weird nails on chalkboard thing for me to watch this a little bit. Lounging in there. Oh my, my God. Planning a brunch on their own behalf. Okay. Wait, can I stop? I haven't even come on screen yet and I'm freaking out. This is, no, this is great. I really wanna be here doing this. This is awesome. No. Roll it. I can do it. And you'd be discussing stopping the show and I just thought how disappointed all the kids would. Yes. Scheming little bitch, please. I'm a child. What is my voice? Even save the speech Rummy. She's fucked. I'm ready. And the goddamn show must go on. I think I'm 16 or 17 here. This is horrifying. Let's continue. I'm supposed to be dressed up as a middle-aged woman in this scene, and I still look like I'm 12 years old. When they get depressed, it's a bottle of scotch plus a little jest. This was my first movie. This was a non-union film. I got paid $75 a day and only on the days that I was acting everybody in this movie went and lived in that. Camp. Basically we were all just up there and there was no cell service, no wifi. I mean, basically the fact that we had running water was a miracle. So it wasn't, um, it wasn't the glamorous, moneymaking prospect that I hoped my first movie would be. Another Chance Toro, some nice, nice sobrato. Okay. Another reason not to move another vodka stinger. That was the first time I was intro introduced to the idea of sugar glass, but it would still like get into my skin a little bit. It would like, like tiny little, almost like paper cuts. Not as bad as paper cuts each take. I'd get little tiny bits of it in and, and there'd be kinda like just little. Dots of blood wounds, whatever. And they kept being like, oh, well, you know, well, let's go take care of you and let's, you know, get first aid or whatever. And I remember being like, no, no, no. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. And feeling like such a fucking hero for being like, I can continue everyone. Oh my God. I was 16. What do you want? Let's carrot for the lady to lunch. Everybody. The hard part of coming from theater. Was that we'd finish a take and I would be like, was was that good? It was very weird to not have that immediate feedback and to just like, look at one guy, the director and be like, so was that good? And he was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we can move on. And that's all you get. So like adjusting to that was tricky. I think I was. Pretty, um, in my head about, uh, how it was going. But I do remember this day actually was the first time that I was like, oh, I think it's, I think it's going good. The director used the phrase, lightning in a bottle, which, uh, which I was like, I don't know what that means yet, but I think it's good. Yeah. Like our tiny little weird movie that we were making. It was like, well, we do like the scene where the insane 12 year old poisons a girl and sings Sondheim. Nailed it. Nice. When we were five, they asked us what we wanted to be when we grew up. Our answers were things like astronaut president, or in my case, a princess. But now that we've grown up, they want a serious answer. Well, how about this? Who the hell knows. Can I just say, I've said this before, but I am just Okay. In this scene at best, after we finished filming this scene, the producers were like, oh, we thought you were gonna do that, that thing you do, because in New Moon there's I, I'm like rambling as we're exiting a movie theater. And I ended up like going on this tangent about zombie movies and stuff that wasn't scripted. They kept it all in and then they gave me this. Speech, and they were like, oh, we thought you were just gonna like, do whatever with it. But I thought that because it was like a a, a speech, speech that I should just stick to the script. This isn't the time to make hard and fast decisions. This is the time to make mistakes. Take the wrong train and get stuck somewhere. Fall in love. A lot major in philosophy because there's no way to make a career out of that. I mostly remember being like, oh, okay. Like the scene went okay. Like, I don't know, maybe they'll cut it. I don't know. And then seeing it in the movie theater, it really was like one of those things where you, uh, have a better understanding of like, The role that editing plays because every time they cut to Kristen, she is so good and she is being so moved by what I'm saying, I can't even remember if I was doing this off camera or if they like shot this on a different day or something. Like either is possible, but like yeah, you do a little push in on Kristen and suddenly you're like, wow, this speech is amazing because she thinks this speech is amazing. I am doing the bare, I don't know what I'm doing. It's, it's very mid, honestly. Cut to her and you're like, I don't know, maybe, maybe Jessica's onto something here. So thanks, Kristin. I can't. I can't. I can't what? I can't do another thing wrong. I can't do another thing wrong. This was actually kind of the line and the moment where I knew, oh, I wanted. Do this movie when she starts having the panic attack and is saying, you don't understand. I can't do another thing wrong cuz that resonated with me so much. Just like cuts to the heart of being in that kind of relationship. When you get into that like regressed, panicked state, um, like those kind of simple sentences come out and you're like, Oh, this is really messed up. I remember that white sweater that I'm wearing, they kept trying to like, clean it off in between takes, um, from the sand. And I remember at a certain point just going like, I, I can't, I can't. And that was kind of all I, I needed to say for everybody to just know like, you know what, it's fine if there's sand on the sweater cuz everybody on set kind of understood the material and what that kind of experience is. Like. Something just as, as small as kind of like, Starting half a sentence and like, uh, like my body language shifting was enough, uh, to be like, you know what, let's prioritize. Just like giving the performer some space. That kind of like ease of communication really helped me on this movie. Tell, what does that even mean? No, I lied to him. He doesn't even know that I'm here. What? I mean he does now He called me. Well, why did you lie to him? Because I'm mad. My scene partner in that gang, Dio was like so amazing. I was really obsessed with her. She's, she's very like her character in the movie. She's like such a badass and I'm very drawn to like tall, stoic women. So I think I followed her around set like a baby bird most. Of the movie. My goal every day was to make her laugh cuz getting a laugh out of Ganio was like hard to earn. It's like when a cat crawls into your lap and you're like, nobody move. That was a hard day. But it was also fun cuz I had a great scene partner and I like was totally in love with her. Is that weird? You wouldn't love me if you knew how bad I am. Jesus. Is that something that he tells you? We bonded really quickly, I think because we knew that the, the material was really challenging emotionally. And you know, it's just one of those things where you're like, well, we could get to know each other slowly, or we could just like rip the bandaid off and be like, Hey, here's everything that's ever happened to me. And I know that I actually have a, a bad habit of doing that. I, I call it like a classic Kendrick overshare cuz every. Situation that I leave. I'm like, Anna, why did you say that? Like constantly telling, um, secrets and gossip about my own life to people. Well, that was fun and hurt my heart and I'm gonna devote a, a session of therapy to that. I hope you all enjoyed, uh, looking at my weird baby face for that long.",Pitch Range,Fillers,i got my ticket for the long way round to by the whiskey father way and i sure would im distracted by my cleavage can i say that is that weird hi im anna kendrick and im about to watch some scenes for my career lets torture ourselves how do you know scott hes a friend its hard for me to keep track sometimes cuz he has so many friends i forgot how passive aggressive and awful stacy is its awesome brian lee omalley who did the graphic novel its based on his real sister stacy i love that shes just a just a little shit stir what an angel ill be honest when i read this script i was like i dont totally get this but i love shawn of the dead i love hot fuzz and i just wanted to work with edgar wright but i do remember like this on paper being like i dont know how this is gonna work but im just gonna trust that uh he sees it which he did its so awesome this is the first fight in the movie the first kinda like sequence that goes crazy and then the bad guy satia starts singing like a a song and i remember sort of being the only one to be like i think that this might be a tough buy for the audience nobody like asked me to but i remember when we were doing my single just doing a bunch of reactions of like whats going on like someone explained this to me i wasnt sure if edgar was gonna be like what are you talking about and then he uh used a couple of those reaction shots and that made me feel happy it was nice meeting you tell your gay friends i said bye gay friends wallace again the crash zoom thing at the end of this once kiran has fully stolen my boyfriend by the end of the scene we had to do that crash zoom so many times because edgars so hyper specific he doesnt even let you blink he doesnt let you blink there would be specific times where he was like oh like uh a purposefully timed blink here would be okay this was very generous of him he wanted me to turn react then the crash zoom happens then i say the line or something something like that bill pope uh the cinematographer ended up taking over just even operating the camera and the crash zoom and i could see like every time we would kind of overcompensate for the other where we had like missed the moment perfectly and it just took forever to this day with edgar im like i do my own crash zooms so the joke is that like if you need to do a crash zoom on me ill just like get myself really close to the camera ah people dont like that the director jason moore and i everywhere we filmed if we saw a cup we would just steal it we had this like weird collection to like try out once we got to this stage we dont know what the surface of the stage is really gonna sound like then we had to justify that the cup was there so uh yeah someone came up with the the pencils and pens thing i did think it was funny to just like dump it out in front of them it feels very much like when a when a cat like is testing you and is like what if i knocked this over what would you do yall gonna miss me when im gonna oh yall gonna miss me here youre gonna miss me everywhere oh i know youre gonna miss me when im gone i had to sing something to prove that i could do it and i was like oh well i i know this thing but cuz im a dork and i learned to do this thing with a cup and theres this song and they were like oh lets put that in the movie the audition song was supposed to be im a little teacup which to this day ive never asked the the writer kay cannon like how was that supposed to play like was it supposed to just be like a really good rendition of im a little teacup cuz i dont think i wouldve been able to pull that off i had no idea that this moment would become what it became when universal

14,"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret. (2023)",Abby Ryder Fortson ,Seventeen,PG-13,106,"Comedy, Drama","7,256,066.00",Female,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Vbg5P6rt4,"1,700.00",337.00,85.00,11.00,"I have a plant collection and I might name them. And make scarfs for them. Hi, I'm Abby Ryer Fortson. I'm here with 17, and this is 17 questions. It was a bit of a long process due to Covid, but the moment that I found out that I had gotten the role, it was a dream come true. I was ecstatic. It was incredible. I remember like screaming up and down in our kitchen, just like jumping around with my brother and my mom and my dad. I was really, really passionate about this project, so I actually wrote a letter to the director. Uh, Kelly and the producer, Jim and I explained how connected I was to the role of Margaret and how I had gone through everything that she had gone through and why I was so passionate about it and it worked. The magic and power of a written letter, I would say that we're pretty similar. I mean, we're both pretty curious. Kind people. While I was shooting Margaret, I was going through a lot of the same things that Margaret goes through in the book and the movie as well. She is one of the kindest people you will ever meet. She is an absolute legend. Just such an inspiration. Honestly. She created this entire world and it was so incredible to meet the person. Who really fought up Margaret and brought her to a book form so that we could bring her to life on the screen. I read a bunch of Judy Bloom's books. When I found out that I got the role, I had like a huge stack of them. I, I don't think I can possibly pick, honestly. They're all so incredible and so true to the human experience. Well, I don't remember any explicit advice that she gave me, but I think that just working with her and seeing how professional that she is and how kind and generous. And welcoming she is to everyone is just such an example for me and for everyone else on set. And it just made it such a nice place to work, sort of I believe in some aspects of it over others. I think some of it makes sense and other parts of it. A little far-fetched. I enjoy doing arts and crafts of all kind. I can knit, I can paint. I draw all the time. I actually recently got into book binding. I taught myself how to do that. I just love being artsy and in all different types of formats, and it's just my way to unwind and de-stress from the. Hard day. I have a plant collection and I might name them and make scarfs for them. I have named all of my plants since I first got them, and I refer to them as my children because they are my babies. Recently I did get in back into knitting and I made a scarf for one of them. Yeah. It's a hard job being a mother to a bunch of plants. My favorite musical would have to be six. I was obsessed with it when it came out. I actually listened to that pretty much all the way through shooting Margaret. That was the only thing I listened to. I was obsessed and don't lose Your Head would probably be my favorite song. I actually shop a lot of my stuff. Like all vintage and thrifted stuff. I did get recently into buying stuff off of Depop, which is like secondhand clothes, brands, all that stuff. And I think it's just really nice to shop sustainably. I have this awesome vintage motorcycle jacket that has all like this cool like metal belts and these cool like shoulder pads and all that, and it's one of my favorite things I own. I would love to control the water. I feel like that's such a cool thing to be able to do, cause. Like waters all around us. And also I'm a surfer, so I'd love to just be able to go out on a day when it's like super flat and just make all these awesome like 10 foot waves come up. I think that growing up in the seventies has a lot of bonuses because I could see a bunch of my favorite bands live in concert. That would be awesome to be able to see, like GL Sabbath. I do think that growing up today has a couple of advantages, especially with all the support that we have now. As teenagers cuz it's hard growing up, like just growing up in general. So I think I would rather grow up now. I think it would have to be shit's creek because I have seen it three or four times. I've watched it myself with my grandma, with my brother, and with my mom. And it is hilarious, and it's definitely a show that I can just turn on, relax and knit to. I would love to work with everyone again. Everyone that I've worked with since I was four has been so incredible and so welcoming. And such an inspiration to work with. Honestly, I would love to be in another movie with Kathy and Rachel, as well as Paul Rudd and Judy Greer and Rebecca Hall and all of them. They've just all been so incredibly welcoming and amazing. I have only been to Canada and across the United States, but I would love to go to New Zealand for like a, a weekend surf trip. Not weekend, but like longer. A, a forever surf trip. A month long surf trip. God, a girl can dream social media kind of scares me. I don't control any of my professional accounts. My parents handle all that for me, and I'm very grateful for that. Does Pinterest count? Cause I get all of my arts and crafts ideas off of there, and I have 25 million boards of just art and aesthetic photos. So just being yourself, I think that's the most important thing, and I think that's really the message of the movie. Thank you guys so much for having me. 17. And make sure you go check out. Are you there?

15,Scream VI (2023),Courteney Cox,InStyle,R,122,"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","108,126,144.00",Female,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3nqX3fNpb8,"43,000.00",586.00,"1,500.00",107.00,"Hi, I'm Courtney Cox. Let's unpack this. Okay. This is ghost face. I've done five different screams, but the last one that is out now was a relaunch. It was a completely different scream, new young characters. It's like a up to date. Really gory fun movie and ghost face. After I see the movie always. I'm always scared that this ghost face will somehow be in my yard. I don't know, but I can't sleep for, for days after I see any scream. One of the things that's really fun about Scream is that I, I've always been able to be a little over the top. I, you know, in the first scream I had these blonde streaks that. Chris McMillan did, who's doing my hair today? And the second scream, I had red, like red streaks or not streaks. The first one was really streaky, the second one was kind of red all, all over kind of, I can't really remember. And the third one was the infamous bangs that are the most unattractive that I've ever been. And I had pencil thin eyebrows with the bangs and it just was not okay. And then the fourth one, I decided I gotta mellow out. And so I just did it parted on the side, which was a big change for me. Cause I always wear my hair in the middle. And then the, um, this last one, she's a little more grounded, my character. So I, I did wear a bright, like red soup in my first scene. Other than that, she's, she took it down the notch or five Ooh, Tampax. Pearl. That's interesting. Um, I did a Tampax commercial and I was the first person to say period on television, but back then when I did that, we didn't have a plastic applicator. It was all cardboard. So it's different. Now. This, this probably is much smoother ride. I don't know. I apparently it's leakage guard, which is great. I really, this is the brand right there. We've got a little mini set of drums, which reminds me because I used to play the drums. I haven't done it in a long time. And, uh, I played the drums on, uh, M T V movie awards and I wasn't that good at it. On camera. Embarrassing. Okay. Wow. This is a very large wine glass. And this reminds me of doing Cougar Town because my character drank a bunch of wine. My character's name was Jules in the name of the wine glass. Oh. Didn't I have a few? I had a few names for cuz I'd break one and then, um, which was devastating and it was always in slow motion and I would, what was the name of my glass? Oh, like Big Joe. Big Joe. Oh, this is, uh, from Ace Ventura. This is Jim Gary. It was really hard to play Melissa Robinson because, uh, he made me laugh all the time, so I was constantly cracking up and he did a lot of ad-libbing. It was really fun. Oh, is there really a book about that or is this, oh, there is Masters of the Universe. I did this movie with Dolph Lundgren. This is a, a book that I don't know that I could read. This is really big. Oh, it's all comic stuff. This must have been like the trilogy or something. I don't think that script is this big, but that was fun. My character's name is Julie and uh, I liked it. Okay, here's a brown belt. So I used to do something called Bud Con and I mean break boards with my hand, with my foot, and uh, I. I wanna say I got a brown belt, but the truth is, is I was about to take my, my, my brown belt. What do you call test or, and, uh, I would've passed it because I was really pretty good at it. And then I got pregnant and I couldn't do it anymore. Oh, I could have, but I was, that was a good excuse to stop. Here we go. Born in the usa I did a Bruce Springsteen video, um, to the song Dancing in the Dark, and that was his first number one single, and I shot it in St. Paul. Brian DePalma directed it and I didn't wanna go up on stage and dance. There was three girls that were cast and they asked me to do that probably cuz it was so uncomfortable. They wanted that, that uncomfortableness and that's what I was able to give them. Okay. Oh, that's fine. Okay, this is, uh, the first time I joined Instagram. This is me, uh, Ellen and Lisa Kudrow. Lisa came and surprised me on the show, and Ellen not made me what she said. Let's, let's open up an Instagram account. And I did. And this is where all of the sleepless nights of me editing these silly videos with my, uh, app. So this is a reason why I haven't slept in a long time. Right there, the girl in the middle. But that was fun. Oh, there's my friend Jen Meyers. She said, this is so exciting. It's exciting. And my friend, Foy Vance, who's an incredible musician, everyone should get his albums, uh, says You made it once you get Instagram, you've made it apparently. Uh, and look, Chris Jenner liked it. Thank you, Chris. Okay. What do we have? Oh my God. This is really a blast from the, you know, dinosaur age. It's a f it's a backstage pass of a company I used to work for called Frontier Booking International. Um, F B I. And this was back in the eighties when we represented every cool band from the eighties, from the Thompson twins to, you know, Robert Palmer, to um, Oingo Bogo, UV 40, the police. Um, there's just, the list goes on and on and on. And the guy who owned it, His name is Ian Copeland. He's an incredible person. He's no longer with us, but he opened up a, a talent part of his agency. And when I say the agency, he used to book the live acts. Then he opened up a commercial division, a little talent department, and. I was, I think one of his first clients that actually went on to, to do, I don't know what I've done. Okay. So I did a show called Shining Bale. Everyone should check it out. It's on stars. And, um, it was an incredible, I love the script, I love the people I worked with. It's the most challenging role that I've ever done. Uh, my character. When people think, like my husband on the show, my, my kids, they think that I'm kind of going a little like I'm depressed, but I'm hallucinating and um, I'm actually being possessed by a ghost. So they don't really understand. So I start taking medicine to help me with my depression and then all goes south and it's really, uh, It's scary, it's funny. Um, I actually, it's, it's, it was really challenging cause I got to play more in that, this one character over eight episodes than I have probably ever. I loved it. We shot Shining Veil at Warner Brothers and we were on stage five, which is where we started friends, and that was really fun. I got to do some behind the scene jobs, uh, at Warner Brothers. I, I drove the tram and I didn't realize how long a tram is. They're long. See, I was taking a turn and I had no idea to worry about the people in the back this close to this, close to hitting it. So that's a lesson I'm not gonna drive buses or trucks. Home stretch. Oh, look at this home stretch. Guess what? This is, um, my product line. This is, uh, a room deodorant. It's a room spray that actually does deodorize, kind of like a for a breeze with a perfumes scent, well, for me is on steroids. It's like, it's incredible. I love this. This is called home court. I have, um, a counters spray, the room spray, um, dish soap, hand soap and hand lotion, and it's really beauty products for the home. And I just, you know, we spend so much time at home. I like walking into the house and my house smells good. So not that cleaning is fun, but it definitely makes it more enjoyable. This is Rose. We have 4 cents. This is rose. It's so, it's actually like a real rose. It doesn't smell powdery or it smells like the pedals and the stem and the leaves, which is really true. This is what we use. Um, and then we have a signature scent of mine called cc. It's what I, the perfumes I wear all mixed together and then I sent it to a perfumer and they did an incredible job replicating that cuz I, I wear two oils and then a perfume on top. Okay. And the last one. Wow. This is a picture of my girls. This is Lisa and Jennifer, and, uh, this is a, this is actually from friends. We did a photo shoot and this is back in that time, obviously, because I have a lot more minds around my mouth when I make that face. And I try not to make that face anymore. That's a no-go for me. These are my friends. And I love them. Thanks for coming to the beach, to Malibu and um, that's what's in that bag.",Pace,Pausing,hi im courtney cox lets unpack this okay this is ghost face ive done five different screams but the last one

this ghost face will somehow be in my yard i dont know but i cant sleep for for days after i see any scream one of the things thats really fun about scream is that i ive always been able to be a little over the top i you know in the first scream i had these blonde streaks that chris mcmillan did whos doing my hair today and the second scream i had red like red streaks or not streaks the first one was really streaky the second one was kind of red all all over kind of i cant really remember and the third one was the infamous bangs that are the most unattractive that ive ever been and i had pencil thin eyebrows with the bangs and it just was not okay and then the fourth one i decided i gotta mellow out and so i just did it parted on the side which was a big change for me cause i always wear my hair in the middle and then the um this last one shes a little more grounded my character so i i did wear a bright like red soup in my first scene other than that shes she took it down the notch or five ooh tampax pearl thats interesting um i did a tampax commercial and i was the first person to say period on television but back then when i did that we didnt have a plastic applicator it

I am Salma Haino and I am going to answer an excessive amount of questions. So they've given me some categories in here and I have to pick from one of them, but to make it more exciting, please, and then I'll just pick whatever. A director or creative you would love to work with and why? Mm, I just work with some really nice one. Um, James Cameron, because we both love the ocean. I'm a diver, so I'd like to do something with him that has to do with the ocean and underwater and. The animals in the ocean. Oh, yes. I would love that. Okay. Um, how do you enforce your boundaries? I have a very big problem with that. I go to the, to, to, to therapy so that they teach me how to have some boundaries. And this is probably my biggest, uh, weak point. I don't have good advice on that. Okay. Now, let's see. Favorite part, Of adulting. That's my dog, SHK favorite part of adulting and not much of an adult. I, I couldn't even recognize the word. I was like, what's that feeling? Comfortable in your own skin? You have no choice because it keeps like, you know, stretching out and stretching out. So you gotta learn to feel comfortable with it. A trend you wish would die. Skinny jeans. If you have the big hips, you're like, oh my God, when is this gonna end? What's your key to a good night's sleep? Melatonin. Sometimes my best trick is just to watch, uh, TV that I don't love and that doesn't make me think, but that it makes the noise. And so my head doesn't think of my own stuff, and uh, eventually it just puts me to sleep, but I make sure it doesn't have a lot of action or n a lot of noise, English murder shows are really covered. Okay. What is your go-to dance move on the dance floor Salsa. What's your favorite smell? Roses. There's another one right here. What were you like as a child? I was very thoughtful. I was very thoughtful with, uh, my animals, my, my parents, my friends. I always had a sense of duty and this a reminder. Or all you kids or millenniums, thoughtfulness is a lovely thing to have. It gets you far in life and it makes you appreciate life more. What are you obsessed with right now? My kids, I admit it. Okay. A trend that needs to come back glamor on every day. Although I do love my sweats, but I, I shouldn't, I, I wish I would have this thing of every day waking up and, you know, trying to look my best for me. But I like comfort. What's your theme song into the Mystic Van Morrison? What was your first car? A Mustang. Let's seem, who are your top three style icons of the nineties? Madonna, uh, prince Diana. What's the best advice anyone ever gave to you? My father said to me, oh many, many times You always have to treat everyone the same. Have you ever ghosted someone? Oh yeah. And by the way, I should ghost more. How often do you floss your teeth? Every day. No choice. When I was younger, I didn't, but now maintenance, they go fast. What's your worst habit? I have a, a long list. A long list of really bad habits. One bad habit is I don't sleep a lot, and sometimes I just want a beer in the middle of the night, but then I start a beer and then it feels like it should go with some chips. And then once you have the salty, then you need like the chocolate for something sweet and it's really hard to get back to bed and try to go to sleep. Thanks, glamor.

I really am. Keep up with her. I'm keeping up with Rita. Rita was trying to dance badly. Dance bad. I gotta stick with her. Oh God. Welcome to round the table, supporting AIE for Brady. And it's for Entertainment Tonight. Entertainment Weekly Entertainment. Last week, it's time for the 80 for Brady, starting lineup. Lily Tomlin, Wayne State University, Barita Moreno. PS 1 32. Sally Field, Birmingham High School, Jane Fonda. College dropout. Lily and I were the first to come on. Yeah. Yeah. We know. And, um, you know, I mean, the producers figured we haven't worked together enough. Right. And who was second? Because, because we, we did a movie. We finished Grace and Frankie, and then about 10 days later we did a movie together. It's coming out in March. What's the name? Well, let's not put Moving On. Call that movie now and then this movie. Um, This movie came along and Lily and I talked to each other. We both thought this is a pretty good idea, but who are the other two parts gonna be? I mean, our wanting to do this depends on who the other two are, and we got lucky. That's when Jane actually called me knowing that she and I had tried to work together several times and it just. Didn't happen. And when she said it was Jane, and that was Lily and I, I've been friends with them both for many, many years. Years. We were trying to figure out years. You, in the early eighties, late seventies, early eighties. Yeah. You in the early eighties when we were like, you know, trying to save the world and working with Helen Caldecott called, right. Um, and then I, and then, and then we learned it was Rita and that was just, Exciting. That was pretty exciting for me cuz I couldn't believe it. Uh, my agent, it was up, my agent who called and he said, there's this movie and, um, they want to, and I said, well, who's in it? And he came up with these amazing names. I said, really? Come on. And he said, no, no, no, that's for real. It's for real. I said, uh, I'll look at the script, but the, you know, the answer is yes, no matter what happens. And if I don't like it, I'll ask for changes. Oh God. And I had just seen you in, in West in the New West Side story. I mean, you won an Oscar for the first one, and in my opinion, you stole that movie. Wow, you stole that movie. Wow. Thank you. You really did. There's stories based on actual women that live in Boston. We never, we haven't got to meet any of them yet. Well, how many are still? Well, there are four with us. There were four originally. Five. And they're four still alive. Yeah. Yeah. And they're in their eighties. Right. And we saw, well, they're in their nineties now. They're in their nineties. They're in their nineties. I know. And they're, they're like you and they, and they are cra I mean, the, the film I saw. Was one of them talking to, uh, Tom Brady, and I thought, I literally thought she was gonna go into coronary arrest. She was screaming and she's watching him on, on a Zoom call, I guess. So it's really nice that it's based on a true story. I thought that made it really, yeah. I mean, it's embellished because not all of that quite happened the way, the way we did it. What Lewis' character brings to our story is, Is made up. The rest of it is, is, yeah. And, and all of the hijinks getting into the Super Bowl. Yeah. And trying to get the tickets because at one point the tickets are lost and, uh, we were all having heart attacks about that after we worked so hard. To achieve this. And, uh, then we go about trying to find a way to get into the, well, I go into a closet with Harry Hamlin while all of you have scenes that are just hysterical, and I Why? I mean, I've been in this, what are you doing in that closet chair? How come. I'm, I read this script and I don't recognize the fact that, wait a minute, these are a lot of funny scenes and I'm in a closet with Harry Lin. Well, okay. That could be, that could be worse. You know, it could be worse. I knew a lot of women who would love to be in a closet with Harry Lin. Yeah, I, at the time it was. Good. But I mean, when you see the movie, it's like, well, where am I? You're in there telling, speaking, I'm bearing my heart now because you're in there. I haven't told you this since I saw the movie, but you're way in there. Look, I so funny. I feel that way too. I feel like, well, I'm not even in this movie. Look at all of them. Are you kidding? I'm not even in this. That eating stuff that you do. God. And when you, you, you get so stoned that you become Guy Fieri. That so funny. She has those little Jelly Bellies. Yeah. Right. Edibles. Edibles. Edibles. That's what they're called. Okay. Aren't you tired of the same old, boring lives? Let's go to the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl is no place for four old women. This could be Tom's last one. He's almost 40. That's like 80 in people years. Yeah, we're 80 in people years. I just really need this trip. Sally is the only one among us who knows much about football. Well, I, I, I'm, I'm probably the biggest sports fan here, even though Jane likes baseball, but probably not as much as I do. Maybe, I don't know if she had a look on her face, but, um, and when do you have time to act or read a script or do anything else from the talk of you? Guys in, mesh in in sports sort of blows me away. Really. You can do it, you can fit it all in. You can have a full and complete life. Lily, I swear. Oh, you can want, actually, I don't think she could. Oh, she couldn't? No. Oh, okay. She goes, when she's into something, it's like Greta Thunberg. It's like, uh, 2000% intense involvement. So if she got into football, we'd never see her again. But that's kind of like me and the Dodgers though. That's what I went in. I mean, with the pandemic and all the dodger, I became like, and the only time I ever went to a Dodgers game was to. See Helen Dell, listen to her play the organ. She doubled for me whenever I did my cocktail organist. Wait, you know what? Say that slower. I don't think people heard what you said. You went to the Dodger game to listen to the organist. That was Helen Dell, who's now pass. But uh, she was really fabulous and that Did she teach you stuff about it? Well, fingery, you know. Yeah. Yeah. And then they would be on the big megatron or whatever you call it. People would get Jumbotron, jumbotron, cocktail organist. I mean, just think of that. I wish some of, I wish just between us one time you would just do a character too, just quietly. Just for us. That would be fun for her to do. Yeah. Organist. It'd be fun for us. Yeah, just for us. We won't let anybody else see. Oh my gosh. Please, ladies, girls. Meta Marcels. No, that would be good. That would be so good character. I wouldn't mind. And then you could be him and the lounge lizard. You could be the hall. What's what's, what's your character? Who's a lounge? Tommy Valore. Tommy Galore. Tommy Valor. I love Tommy Vere and the lounge. Li. You could be both of you. Could be both. You see, you two could be civil. Oh, it's too late for that now, isn't it? 72 Oscar Fields never two. Well, we did not strengthen our bond during filmmaking. No, we tested. Tested all the bonds. Yes, that's right. No, we didn't do that. We tested the bonds and the rest of us are paying for it in the number of hours we have in, what's it called? Rehab. No, no. When you have to redo all the sound because someone was talking. Oh, adr. Oh, looping. Thank you. Oh, someone was talking. Are we gonna look at me now? No, I'm looking at her. Did I do that? No, I did probably. But it's a kind of comedy that works. You just keep it going. Yeah. She called me Gabby Hayes throughout it. Get it. Gabby Hayes is a pretty good thing. That's a good name for you, Gabby Hayes. Yeah. He was a little, a little ball of energy. Yeah. Anyway, he was ing diamond talking like this. This was my favorite person when I was screaming. A little beard and a peg leg. You could do him a peg leg. You could do, you haven't done a GA leg hase did not have a peg leg. No, you, no, he did not. But he had no teeth. He had no teeth. Just talk like this. I came in saying, uh, wait, hold on. I am. I Then I was 75. I'm not 76, I'm, I'm not 80. I, I'm, I'm gonna be proud to be 80 and I'm, I'm not there yet. And in the, in the, we adlibbed something in the seam where I said, hold on, hold on. I, I'm not 80. And, and Rita said, and neither am I, I'm 90. So, um, we had some eighties and some seventies and some nineties. So, so we weren't, um, we weren't all eighties. That must have rounded us out to like a nice, like 85. Yeah, I think that, I think that's exactly what it, but was it your idea to cross out the ad on the back of your Uh, I think when, when they, when, um, our costume department heard me constantly saying, no, no, no, I'm not that, I'm not, that they said, you know what? We better make, make that, uh, a legitimate change here. And they, and they, that's, but they should have done it on Rita's too. They should have said 90 crossed up. 90. That's true. That's true. Mature. So much more vain than we know that. I mean, my God. What? I wouldn't become dead in that hat. That's adorable. I'm kidding. Games about to start. There's Oh, what a beautiful, I like Gronkowski. We know Trish, we've all read your gro eroica. It's not a Rodica. It's. Fan fiction, very sexy fan fiction. Tell us about the whole Gronkowski scene. That's the one I wanted to be in. Tell me about that, how that would, it would've been funny if it was you, because when I pick up the book and realize he's reading the book I wrote about him, which was his sex book. Yeah, you call it Erotica Uhhuh. Uh, and I turned and I bumped into him. I bumped into him about two inches below his breast bone. You would've been at his kneecap. Yeah, that would've looked weird. Weird. Yeah. You would've been looking up at the, no, I don't think so. I don't. I don't think so. Don't go here. I spoke to his belt and enjoyed every minute of it. Every minute. Hey, it's khaki's belt. It was fun. I, I realized that Gronkowski, who was my wet dream in the movie, um, was reading the book that I wrote called Between a Gronk and a Hard Place. That's the book title in the movie Gronk and our movie in the movie folks. And, uh, and I pick it up and I turn around and I bump right into this guy and I swear to, to see him required this. I all the work like that and I just, I said, and it wasn't in the script. You're so big. And his smile is, isn't that smile. And when he says Thank you with that dear smile, that's huge. I get a big laugh. Huge man saying, Thank you. Yes. So see, I'm a character who, uh, I'm scared of getting old and, and, and all I want to do is please men and have boyfriends. And I flirt with everybody and want to marry them after a week. And I promise to my girlfriends, this is a girl's trip. I won't flirt. I won't flirt, I swear. And then I catch her in the closet. With Harry Hamlin. Hamlin. Well then you and I had a dance together with, with completely kind of improvised, you know, and then we had a little bit of chore, but they don't show my part. They do that. Was you with me? Well, at the dance party there were, well, oh, you mean when we do the home? Getting into the scene stuff was, was choreographed. Okay. It, it was, we might have improvised and we kept complaining. This is, uh, two too accom, too advanced. You guys kept, it's gotta be simpler. We, we were complaining and I had just had, I had her replacement the surgery so I couldn't lift my arm up and I just hid behind everybody else. I just wanted to dance next to Rita once. It was so much fun. We had just once in my, didn't we have fun? We did, and she was so adorable because she loves to bounce. I, I was, I don't anymore. She's a bouncer and I love watching her. She's so adorable. She's Don't say adorable. You can't do adorable anymore. Well, honey, you're stuck with it. I was trying to find a way to not not dance well, you know. Oh, come on. It's true. You were trying to dance. Dance down. No, I was, yes, absolutely. I was dancing down. I felt so good to be standing next to you and all the time you were dancing down heard this exchange. She is. Fighting to dance next to Rita. I really am. Keep up with her. I'm keeping up with Rita. Rita was trying to dance badly. Dance, dance bad. I gotta stick with her. Oh god. Well, because the first thing I ran into when we realized we had to do this little dance and it was little was. That everybody to the, to the woman said, oh my God, but you're the dancer and you know how, and they wouldn't stop with that. And then I thought, well, I didn't say it. I kept, I kept my mouth. No, you didn't. I tried not to these two. I thought it, you're the dancer. You are the dancer. I thought it, I thought it the whole way and I was saying a lot of it to try to protect you all because of your age. I appreciate that. I remember that. I always protected. Oh, I do. I wish I had listened. I wish I'd listened. Year later, a year later, I'm barely moving. Is that what you But may I just say that everyone was up. It's a charming number. It really is. I can't believe we're actually here taking this one. He's cute. So you don't have any tickets? How much for four? 10,000. 10,000. Well, I have a 20 in my strap on That's a fanny pack. If you were it like this. It's a strap on. Wow. And so when you really, when you ate those hot wings Yeah. You were sitting there watching me, remember? I was Was that really hot? No. Oh, I more than that. What did you do after each take? We don't want, yeah, it was, oh boy, was it hot? Because they also don't need to know that they never really ate it. It took all those big bites. And as you well know, the minute they said, can I spit it all out in a bucket? And a big bucket full of half eaten chicken. But you didn't hear that. Nobody secret that. No, don't say that. Okay. Williams, we screwed up kill rights on the eating part. Every bit of that. Very, very special. I just thought that when you had a scene with, and you were chewing Jen, it was, and you were talking to Guy Fieri and it was, that was so funny. I, I mean, I almost. Yeah, I have to cross my legs. Well, you could have, you could have had that night have gone in the closet. Tom was astonishing. You know, Tom as an actor was astonishing I think to all of us and certainly to me. But you, you know, there's something that actors are able to do and not, and that is, Listen. Now that seems like, I know that civilians say, listen, what do you mean? Listen, of course he listens. It's the way in which you listen and absorb what the other actor is saying. But you know, he really, he nailed it. Yeah, but I'm talking about her nailing, talking about her nailing at that beach that she made. That changed. Maybe she everything. She has an opinion. Well, I don't think, don't. She does. I watched Don't You were extraordinary. She was one that was crying when you were shooting. Well, anyway, what I think about that scene? Yeah, what mean, uh, I, how I prepared the whole, I mean, how I thought and prepared for the whole movie was that, uh, he was my son. I don't think of, uh, him sexually, you know, being seduced by this large, perfect boy, man. But I thought of him as my son, which was much more age appropriate. And then I was going to his, uh, high school or college, college freshman year or something, seeing him play quarterback. I have to stop and pause on it. No, it was quarterback. Quarterback. I, I know My god's, the title. It took me some time to think of it and I gave him a pep talk, but I thought totally I failed it. I mean, I'm so pleased that that Ms. Fonda has moved by it and some other people too. Even people in the media. I wanted to say in the speech, I tried to get the director to let me say it, what I don't think it would've been, it would've been a kind of funny release. It wouldn't have made the the, it wouldn't have negated the speech, I don't think. And I think it would've been totally in wonderfully comedic inspiration. And that was, I was gonna say, You know, when the football becomes, the football player becomes the football. You've said this before, did before you, and you know what, you've told us this line before and you get the same cricket response that you're getting right now. We go, I couldn't get them to, so the, I did film it a couple of times. You did? Yeah. You, I tried to throw it in and it made no sense to me. Then. Well, I don't know. I, I think you're missing, oh, it makes sense to me. I think really. It's like when an actor goes in those moments of of of when you become the character. When you become the character, exactly. When the football, yeah. But you become, and when you, when you're reading a book and you, you, you're not reading anymore. You become book the dancer becomes the dance. Okay. Is the word Words becomes the dance. I get it. That's TS Elliot. That it, I know that originated there, so I know it. I played Maria Callis in the play. Masterclass and, um, well, I wish I'd seen that and you tried out for it, right? No, no. I tell you something, and I'm the most unspiritual person in life. I was visited by her one, one time during performance. I swear to you, I felt her presence. She has a very, the, the actress has a very long monologue, and I'm telling you that Maria, Callis visited me on that stage one night. It was amazing. And when I did a part in homicide, uh, you know, life on the streets Yeah. For which I was nominated for an Emmy and I should have won. Right. Uh, I, I, um, who visited you? No, they didn't invent me, but I sang that some ambul as, uh, As an opera teacher. Yeah. I had murdered my, my husband's girlfriend. Yeah. And I'd put my hat on. I'd taken her hat and put it on my head. Yeah. Anyway, I sang that. I was on a, I was singing Yeah. Son Bula. I, I was, I'm Americanized it Sonam, so, okay. And then that's all I'm just saying. Oh. So then I, and then I saw the masterclass and I was, uh, you put that together. I was just visited the song came to me. And then later I sang it in a show. Oh, okay. Wow. Gosh. I don't have time to explain all I got that one. I got that one talked about Tom. We said how good an actor he was. He's good. Tom's good. Well, how, how, how do you feel, Rita? I think we all feel, I think Tom's good. Tom was great. Tom is wonderful. Tom, any kind, I think we discussed that before. Very sweet and considerate and concerned about how he's acting for you and how, uh, And how you, is he doing anything that's not, but when Lily, when Lily does that long speech to him and he is listening to it, I'm telling you, I said, Man, it's like he's listening to it for the first time. And that's what listening really means in acting terms, that you're hearing something for the very first time. Preach. That's very hard to do. He, it is so great to meet your beauty. Has no expiration date, Kris. I didn't flirt. He did. There's so much here to do. We could even win these tickets. This is a spicy wings contest. I could use a little spice. I know her if you black out who you want me to call an ambulance. I took a pair of very tight bedazzled jeans home with me. Did did any of you take any of your ? Because you all had really interesting. I didn't, I didn't have one single entry thing. Interesting. No, you didn't. That's right. Remember I took a couple of things home. I asked first, uh, well, I asked in a different way. First I said, can this fall off the truck? And uh, which is something you say when you wanna take something home that you wore, you fell off the truck. I took which one? I took one of the amazing, um, Dusters. Oh, okay. And, uh, you had several. I have, I have a couple of them, but I had, I do have to What did you I asked for, I asked permission. It did not fall off the truck. Well, didn't you wear one yesterday on Kelly Foxen? No. What did you take off the truck? I didn't take any, I don't know. Usually I, usually they give me my clothes, all of 'em. But my clothes, I wore dirty clothes in that I wore, I was just pitiful. People felt sorry for me. I had very, they didn't even offer you the clothes, did they? No, they felt, of course not. They a the clothes are pretty fabulous. Oh, they were? Well, they were fun. Oh, you know what I took, you know, my, my scarf that had the bangs attached? Oh, yes. Took that. That's funny. That is serious. I took, I took my headband from. See sort of the same. Yeah. Yeah. I, I took nothing. Matter of fact, some of those clothes were my own, like sweatpants them back, them afterwards. Come on, you put 'em on the trucks. This one, I put 'em on the truck so that I wanted to wear a hat that I love, but nobody bought it. And it's my favorite hat. It says, uh, it says, so far, this is as old as I've ever been. I love that hat. Oh, that's a good one. Isn't that swell? Yeah. I love that hat. These are good. Very good. Oh, careful. They're high dosage. High dosage. Excuse me. I'm looking for someone. I'm Guy Fi. We had to rewrite the last scene because he had been retired when we wrote, when we, uh, performed that last scene in the movie. And then right after that, luckily we were still shooting. Well, no, we had, it was a little, it was kind of, go ahead, you straighten. It was choreographed a little bit when we kind of knew a little bit in advance, but seeing the way things are going right now, we may have to reshoot yet, yet again. No, I don't know. I don't know. Um, but um, but we did, they have to, we did have to rewrite. We inserted that in that last scene was inserted in. Yeah. But many things were changing along the way. Remember, so much stuff was changed and rewritten and the way filming goes, it's constantly stuff being thrown at you and ripped out from under you. And so, but what do we think about him deciding not to retire? Do we have any opinions? Well, um, this, this season for him was a really, really tough one. I was hard for me to watch cuz I didn't want him to get hurt. Um, but, but, um, I, I, I think he'll be, I think he'll be back, uh, my feeling is he'll come back again. Another, another season. Uh, I wish he'd like moved teams, but that's my own opinion. But he kind of dazzled here. See, I wish he changed teams too. Well, he did. I think, well again, he talked about changing teams. Same. Yeah. What were you gonna say? Changing. Changing teams again. Yeah. Wow. Because he who in 17 thought he was gonna pull that game out. And he did. Yeah, exactly. That's, I I thought he might he out again. I think he likes to get in a tough spot. He does. He does. He times it that way, but then clean it up. Oops. Do we, do we think we'll not, do you think, like, Tom, we, we, we, we won't retire. Well, well, we still got it. What, what do you think? What do you think the thing is that our, I know. Yeah. Cause she still have it is so dependent on what other people think. What is the it that other people think about? Right. Well, it's also athletes, you know, it's a different world. That's right. They either have do well, they're, you know, it's contingent upon their body, being able to hold it together. I mean, our bodies are being held together by, by toothpicks right now. And titanium. Titanium. And we're, we can still, you know, go on. Well, Lou, Lou says, you know, Tom is, uh, Come on, Tom Thomas. 40 years old. That's almost, that's 80 years in people. Yeah, exactly. And people, that's my favorite lines. Exactly. So different actors have a different, different road to home word. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't, well, we don't like me or not I'm gonna, it's gonna last No, it's however that they like you or like me. It's whether they think I'm employable, you know? Yeah. Whether you can sell tickets. Yeah. Well, there aren't any tickets hardly anymore. You can go. You can, you know. What about places do you go to? Do you go to movie theaters?

welcome to round the table supporting aie for brady and its for entertainment tonight entertainment weekly entertainment last week its time for the 80 for brady starting lineup lily tomlin wayne state university barita moreno ps 1 32 sally field birmingham high school jane fonda college dropout lily and i were the first to come on yeah yeah we know and um you know i mean the producers figured we havent worked together enough right and who was second because because we we did a movie we finished grace and frankie and then about 10 days later we did a movie together its coming out in march whats the name well lets not put moving on call that movie now and then this movie um this movie came along and lily and i talked to each other we both thought this is a pretty good idea but who are the other two parts gonna be i mean our wanting to do this depends on who the other two are and we got lucky thats when jane actually called me knowing that she and i had tried to work together several times and it just didnt happen and when she said it was jane and that was lily and i ive been friends with them both for many many years years we were trying to figure out years you in the early eighties late seventies early eighties yeah you in the early eighties when we were like you know trying to save the world and working with helen caldecott called right um and then i and then and then we learned it was rita and that was just exciting that was pretty exciting for me cuz i couldnt believe it uh my agent it was up my agent who called and he said theres this movie and um they want to and i said well whos in it and he came up with these amazing names i said really come on and he said no no no thats for real its for real i said uh ill look at the script but the you know the answer is yes no matter what happens and if i dont like it ill ask for changes oh god and i had just seen you in in west in the new west side story i mean you won an oscar for the first one and in my opinion you stole that movie wow you stole that movie wow thank you you really did theres stories based on actual women that live in boston we never we havent got to meet any of them yet well how many are still well there are four with us there were four originally five and theyre four still alive yeah yeah and theyre in their eighties right and we saw well theyre in their nineties now theyre in their nineties theyre in their nineties i know and theyre theyre like you and they and they are cra i mean the the film i saw was one of them talking to uh tom brady and i thought i literally thought she was gonna go into coronary arrest she was screaming and shes watching him on on a zoom call i guess so its really nice that its based on a true story i thought that made it really yeah i mean its embellished because not all of that quite happened the way the way we did it what lewis character brings to our story is is made up the rest of it is is yeah and and all of the hijinks getting into the super bowl yeah and trying to get the tickets because at one point the tickets are lost and uh we were all having heart attacks about that after we worked so hard to achieve this and uh then we go about trying to find a way to get into the well i go into a closet with harry hamlin while all of you have scenes that are just hysterical and i why i mean ive been in this what are you doing in that closet chair how come im i read this script and i dont recognize the fact that wait a minute these are a lot of funny scenes and im in a closet with harry lin well okay that could be that could be worse you know it could be worse i knew a lot of women who would love to be in a closet with harry lin yeah i at the time it was good but i mean when you see the movie its like well where am i youre in there telling speaking im bearing my heart now because youre in there i havent told you this since i saw the movie but youre way in there look i so funny i feel that way too i feel like well im not even in this movie look at all of them are you kidding im not even in this that eating stuff that you do god and when you you you get so stoned that you become guy fieri that so funny she has those little jelly bellies yeah right edibles edibles edibles thats what theyre called okay arent you tired of the same old boring lives lets go to the super bowl the super bowl is no place for four old women this could be toms last one hes almost 40 thats like 80 in people years yeah were 80 in people years i just really need this trip sally is the only one among us who knows much about football well i i im im probably the biggest sports fan here even though jane likes baseball but probably not as much as i do maybe i dont know if she had a look on her face but um and when do you have time to act or read a script or do anything else from the talk of you guys in mesh in in sports sort of blows me away really you can do it you can fit it all in you can have a full and complete life lily i swear oh you can want actually i dont think she could oh she couldnt no oh okay she goes when shes into something its like greta thunberg its like uh 2000 intense involvement so if she got into football wed never see her again but thats kind of like me and the dodgers though thats what i went in i mean with the pandemic and all the dodger i became like and the only time i ever went to a dodgers game was to see helen dell listen to her play the organ she doubled for me whenever i did my cocktail organist wait you know what say that slower i dont think people heard what you said you went to the dodger game to listen to the organist that was helen dell whos now pass but uh she was really fabulous and that did she teach you stuff about it well fingery you know yeah yeah and then they would be on the big megatron or whatever you call it people would get jumbotron jumbotron cocktail organist i mean just think of that i wish some of i wish just between us one time you would just do a character too just quietly just for us that would be fun for her to do yeah organist itd be fun for us yeah just for us we wont let anybody else see oh my gosh please ladies girls meta marcels no that would be good that would be so good character i wouldnt mind and then you could be him and the lounge lizard you could be the hall whats whats whats your character whos a lounge tommy valore tommy galore tommy valor i love tommy vere and the lounge li you could be both of you could be both you see you two could be civil oh its too late for that now isnt it 72 oscar fields never two well we did not strengthen our bond during filmmaking no we tested tested all the bonds yes thats right no we didnt do that we tested the bonds and the rest of us are paying for it in the number of hours we have in whats it called rehab no no when you have to redo all the sound because someone was talking oh adr oh looping thank you oh someone was talking are we gonna look at me now no im looking at

to think of it and i gave him a pep talk but i thought totally i failed it i mean im so pleased that that ms fonda has moved by it and some other people too even people in the media i wanted to say in the speech i tried to get the director to let me say it what i dont think it wouldve been it wouldve been a kind of funny release it wouldnt have made the the it wouldnt have negated the speech i dont
